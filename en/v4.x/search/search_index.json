This allows developers to build applications that collect data, analyze it, and communicate the results in real time. This section illustrates the architecture of Siddhi and guides you through its key functionality. We hope this article helps developers to understand Siddhi and its codebase better, and also contribute to improve Siddhi by reporting and fixing bugs. Main Design Decisions Event by event processing of real-time streaming data to achieve low latency. Ease of use with Streaming SQL providing an intuitive way to express stream processing logic and complex event processing constructs such as Patterns. Achieve high performance by processing all events in-memory and by storing their states in-memory. Optimizing performance by enforcing a strict schema for event streams and by pre-compiling the queries. Optimizing memory consumption by having only the absolutely necessary information in-memory and dropping the rest as soon as possible. Supporting multiple extension points to accommodate a diverse set of functionality such as supporting multiple sources, sinks, functions, aggregation operations, windows, etc. High Level Architecture At a high level, Siddhi consumes events from various events sources, processes them according to the defined Siddhi application, and produces results to the subscribed event sinks. Siddhi can store and consume events from in-memory tables or from external data stores such as RDBMS , MongoDB , Hazelcast in-memory grid, etc. (i.e., when configured to do so). Siddhi also allows applications and users to query Siddhi via its Store Query API to interactively retrieve data from its in-memory and other stores. Main Modules in Siddhi Siddhi comprises four main modules, they are: Siddhi Query API : This allows you to define the execution logic of the Siddhi application as queries and definitions using POJO classes. Internally, Siddhi uses these objects to identify the tasks that it is expected to perform. Siddhi Query Compiler : This allows you to define the Siddhi application using the Siddhi Streaming SQL, and then it converts the Streaming SQL script to Siddhi Query POJO Objects so that Siddhi can execute them. Siddhi Core : This builds the execution runtime based on the defined Siddhi Application and processes the events as and when they arrive. Siddhi Annotation : This is a helper module that allows all extensions to be annotated, so that they can be picked by Siddhi Core for processing. This also helps Siddhi to generate the extension documentation. Siddhi Component Architecture The following diagram illustrates the main components of Siddhi and how they work together. Here the Siddhi Core module maintains the execution logic. It also interacts with the external environment and systems for consuming and publishing events. To achieve these tasks, it uses the following components: SiddhiManager : This is a key component of Siddhi Core that manages Siddhi Application Runtimes and facilitates their functionality via Siddhi Context with periodic state persistence, statistics reporting and extension loading. SiddhiAppRuntime : A Siddhi Application Runtime is generated for each Siddhi Application deployed. Siddhi Application Runtimes provide an isolated execution environment for each Siddhi Application defined. These Siddhi Application Runtimes are based on the logic of their Siddhi Application, and they consume and publish events from various external systems and Java or Python programmes. SiddhiContext : This is a shared object for all the Siddhi Application Runtimes within the Siddhi manager, and it contains references to the persistence store for periodic persistence, statistics manager to report performance statistics of Siddhi Application Runtimes, and extension holders for loading Siddhi extensions. Siddhi Application Creation Execution logic in Siddhi is composed as a Siddhi Application, and this is passed as a string to SiddhiManager to create the SiddhiAppRuntime for execution. When a Siddhi Application is passed to the SiddhiManager.createSiddhiAppRuntime() , it is processed internally with the SiddhiCompiler . Here, the SiddhiApp String is converted to SiddhiApp object model by the SiddhiQLBaseVisitorImpl class. The model is then passed to the SiddhiAppParser for the SiddhiAppRuntime creation. Siddhi App Execution Flow Following diagram depicts the execution flow within a Siddhi App Runtime. The path taken by events within Siddhi is indicated in blue. The components that are involved in handling the events are as follows: StreamJunction This routes events to various components within the Siddhi App Runtime. A stream junction is generated for each stream defined or inferred in the Siddhi Application. A stream junction by default uses the incoming event's thread for processing subscribed components, but it can also be configured via the @Async annotation to buffer the events and use a different thread for subsequent execution. InputHandler An instance of input handler is created for each stream junction, and this is used for pushing Event and Event[] objects into stream junctions from sources, and Java/Python programmes. StreamCallback This receives Event[] s from stream junction and passes them to sinks to publish to external endpoints, or passes them to subscribed Java/Python programmes for further processing. Queries Partitions These components process the events by filtering, transforming, joining, patten matching, etc. They consume events from one or more stream junctions, process them and publish the processed events into stream junctions based on the defined query or partition. Source Sources consume events from external sources in various data formats, convert them into Siddhi events and pass them to corresponding Stream Junctions via their Input Handlers. A source is generated for each @Source annotation defined above a stream definition. Each source consumes events from an external source in the data format configured for it. SourceMapper A source mapper needs to be configured for each source in order to convert the format of each incoming event to that of a Siddhi event. The source mapper type can be configured using the @Map annotation within the @Source annotation. When the @Map annotation is not defined, Siddhi uses the PassThroughSourceMapper , where it assumes that the incoming message is already in the Siddhi Event format, and therefore makes no changes to the event format. Sink Sinks convert the Siddhi Events to various data formats and publish them to external endpoints. A Sink generated for each @Sink annotation defined above a stream definition to publish the events arriving to that stream. SinkMapper A sink mapper is configured for each Sink in order to map the Siddhi events to the specified data format so that they can be published via the sink. The sink mapper type can be configured using the @Map annotation within the @Sink annotation. When the @Map annotation is not defined, Siddhi uses PassThroughSinkMapper , where it passes the Siddhi events in the existing format (i.e., the Siddhi event format) to the Sink. Table Tables store events. By default, Siddhi uses the InMemoryTable implementation to store events in-memory. When @Store annotation is used, it loads the associated Table implementation based on the defined store type. Most table implementations are extended from the AbstractRecordTable abstract class for ease of development. Window Windows store events and determine when events can be considered expired based on the given window constrain. Multiple types of windows are can be implemented by extending the WindowProcessor abstract class. IncrementalAggregation This allows you to obtain aggregates in an incremental manner for a specified set of time periods. Incremental aggregation functions can be implemented by extending IncrementalAttributeAggregator . Trigger A trigger triggers events at a given interval to the stream junction that has the same name as the trigger. QueryCallback A query callback receives notifications when events are emitted from queries. Then it notifies the event occurrence timestamp , and classifies the events into currentEvents , and expiredEvents . Siddhi Query Execution Siddhi QueryRuntimes can be categorized in to three main types: SingleInputStream : Queries that consist of query types such as filters and windows. JoinInputStream : Queries that consist of joins. StateInputStream : Queries that consist of patterns and sequences. Following section explains the internals of each query type. SingleInputStream Query Runtime (Filter Windows) A single input stream query runtime is generated for filter and window queries. They consume events from a stream junction or a window and convert the incoming events according to the expected output stream format at the ProcessStreamReceiver by dropping all the unrelated incoming stream attributes. Then the converted events are passed through a few Processors such as FilterProcessor , StreamProcessor , StreamFunctionProcessor , WindowProcessor and QuerySelector . Here, the StreamProcessor , StreamFunctionProcessor , and WindowProcessor can be extended with various stream processing capabilities. The last processor of the chain of processors must always be a QuerySelector , and each chain can have only one WindowProcessor . When the query runtime consumes events from a window, its chain of processors cannot contain a WindowProcessor . The FilterProcessor is implemented with an ExpressionExecutor that returns a boolean value. Expressions have a tree structure, and they are processed based on the Depth First Search algorithm. To achieve high performance, Siddhi currently depends on the user to formulate the least successful case in the leftmost side of the condition, thereby increasing the chance of an early false detection. The condition expression price = 100 and ( Symbol == 'IBM' or Symbol == 'MSFT' ) is represented as shown below. These expressions also support the execution of user defined functions (UDFs), and they can be implemented by extending the FunctionExecutor class. After getting processed by each processor, each event reaches the QuerySelector for transformation. At the QuerySelector , events are transformed based on the select clause of the query. If there is a Group By defined, then the GroupByKeyGenerator identifies the group by key, and then each AttributeProcessor is executed based on that group-by key. AttributeProcessors can contain any expression including constant values, variables and user defined functions. They can also contain AttributeAggregator s for processing aggregation operations such as sum , count , etc. Here, an AttributeAggregator is generated to keep track of the aggregation state. When it becomes obsolete, it is destroyed. The events are transformed to the expected output format through this operation. After an event is transformed to the output format, it is evaluated against the HavingConditionExecutor if a having clause is provided. Only the succeeding events are pushed to the OutputRateLimiter . At OutputRateLimiter , the event output is controlled before sending the events to the stream junction or to the query callback. When the output clause is not defined, the PassThroughOutputRateLimiter is used by passing all the events without any rate limiting. Temporal Processing with Windows The temporal event processing aspect is achieved via Window and AttributeAggregators To achieve temporal processing,Siddhi uses the following four type of events: Current Events : Events that are newly arriving to a query from streams. Expired Events : Events that have expired from a window. Timer Events : Events that inform the query about an update of execution time. These events are usually generated by schedulers. Reset Events : Events that resets the Siddhi query states. In Siddhi, when an event comes into a WindowProcessor , it creates an appropriate expired event corresponding to the incoming current event with the expiring timestamp, and stores that event in the window. The WindowProcessor also forwards the current event to the next processor for further processing. It uses a scheduler or such to determine when to emit the events it has in memory. During that time, it emits these events as expired events. If it needs to emit all the events in the memory at once, it emits a single reset event instead of sending one expired event for each event it has stored, so that it can reset the states in one go. For each current event emitted from a window, a corresponding expired event must be emitted. If not, a common reset event must be emitted. This is vital in Siddhi because Siddhi relies on these events to calculate the Aggregations at the QuerySelector . In the QuerySelector , the arrived current events increase the aggregation values, expired events decrease the values, and reset events reset the aggregation calculation. For example, the sliding TimeWindow creates a corresponding expired event for each current event that arrives, adds that to the window, adds an entry to the scheduler to notify when that event need to be expired by sending it a timer event, and finally sends the current event to the next processor for subsequent processing. When the window receives an indication that the expected expiry time has come for the oldest event in the window via a a timer event or other means, it removes the expired event from the window and passes that to the next processor. JoinInputStream Query Runtime (Join) Join input stream query runtime is generated for join queries. This can consume events from two stream junctions and perform a join operation as depicted above. It can also perform a join by consuming events from one stream junction and join against itself, or it can join against a table, window or an incremental aggregation. When a join is performed with a table, window or incremental aggregation, the WindowProcessor in the image is replaced with the table, window or incremental aggregation. No basic processors are used on their side. The joining operation is triggered by the events that arrive from the stream junction. Here, when an event from one stream reaches the pre JoinProcessor , it matches against all the available events of the other stream's WindowProcessor . When a match is found, those matched events are sent to the QuerySelector as current events, and at the same time, the original event is added to the WindowProcessor where it remains until it expires. Similarly, when an event expires from the WindowProcessor , it matches against all the available events of the other stream's WindowProcessor , and when a match is found, those matched events are sent to the QuerySelector as expired events. Note: Despite the optimizations, a join query is quite expensive when it comes to performance. This is because the WindowProcessor is locked during the matching process to avoid race conditions and to achieve accuracy while joining. Therefore, avoid matching large windows in high volume streams. Based on the scenario, using appropriate window sizes (by time or length) helps to achieve maximum performance. StateInputStream Query Runtime (Pattern Sequence) The state input stream query runtime is generated for pattern and sequence queries. This consumes events from one or more stream junctions via ProcessStreamReceivers . A ProcessStreamReceiver and a set of basic processors is defined in the query for each condition. When a ProcessStreamReceiver consumes the events, it updates the states with the incoming events that are generated by previous conditions. If the condition applied is the first condition in the query, then it creates a new state and updates that with the incoming event. This is then passed to basic processors to perform filtering and transformation operations. The states that pass the basic processors are consumed by the PostStateProcessor and stored at the PreStateProcessor of the following pattern or sequence condition. When the state reaches the final condition's PostStateProcessor , the output event is generated and emitted by QuerySelector . Siddhi Partition Execution A partition is a wrapper around one or more Siddhi queries and inner streams that connect them. A partition is implemented in Siddhi as a PartitionRuntime , and each unique partition instance is implemented as a PartitionInstanceRuntime Each partitioned stream entering the partition goes through the appropriate PartitionStreamReceiver . The PartitionExecutor of stream receiver evaluates the incoming events to identify the partition key using the RangePartitionExecutor or the ValuePartitionExecutor , and passes the events to the QueryRuntimes of the appropriate PartitionInstanceRuntime based on the partition key. If a PartitionInstanceRuntime is not available for the given partition key, it is dynamically generated via the relevant QueryRuntimes and InnerStreamJunctions . Based on the partition definition, the QueryRuntimes in the PartitionInstanceRuntime wire themselves via inner StreamJunctions or using StreamJunctions outside the partitions. When a partition query consumes a non partitioned global stream, all instances of its QueryRuntime that are part of multiple PartitionInstanceRuntimes receive the same event as depicted in the above diagram. Siddhi Event Formats Siddhi has three event formats. Event This is the format exposed to end users when they send events via Input Handler, and consume events via Stream Callback or Query Callback. This consists of an Object[] that contains all the values in accordance to the corresponding stream. StreamEvent (Subtype of ComplexEvent ) This is used within queries. This contains the following three Object[] s: - beforeWindowData : This contains values that are only used in processors that are executed before the WindowProcessor . - onAfterWindowData : This contains values that are only used by the WindowProcessor and the other processors that follow it, but not sent as output. - outputData : This contains the values that comply with the output stream of the query. In order to optimize the amount of data that is stored in the in-memory at windows, the content in beforeWindowData is cleared before the event enters the WindowProcessor . StreamEvents can also be chained by linking each other via the next property in them. StateEvent (Subtype of ComplexEvent ) This is used in Joins, Patterns and Sequences when we need to associate events of multiple streams, tables, windows and aggregations of different types together. This has a collection of StreamEvents representing different streams, tables, etc, that are used in the query, and outputData to contain the values that are needed for the query output. StreamEvents can also be chained by linking each other with the next property in them. Event Chunks Event Chunks provide an easier way of manipulating the chain of StreamEvents and StateEvents so that they are be easily iterated, inserted and removed.

The FilterProcessor is implemented with an ExpressionExecutor that returns a boolean value. Expressions have a tree structure, and they are processed based on the Depth First Search algorithm. To achieve high performance, Siddhi currently depends on the user to formulate the least successful case in the leftmost side of the condition, thereby increasing the chance of an early false detection. The condition expression price = 100 and ( Symbol == 'IBM' or Symbol == 'MSFT' ) is represented as shown below. These expressions also support the execution of user defined functions (UDFs), and they can be implemented by extending the FunctionExecutor class. After getting processed by each processor, each event reaches the QuerySelector for transformation. At the QuerySelector , events are transformed based on the select clause of the query. If there is a Group By defined, then the GroupByKeyGenerator identifies the group by key, and then each AttributeProcessor is executed based on that group-by key. AttributeProcessors can contain any expression including constant values, variables and user defined functions. They can also contain AttributeAggregator s for processing aggregation operations such as sum , count , etc. Here, an AttributeAggregator is generated to keep track of the aggregation state. When it becomes obsolete, it is destroyed. The events are transformed to the expected output format through this operation. After an event is transformed to the output format, it is evaluated against the HavingConditionExecutor if a having clause is provided. Only the succeeding events are pushed to the OutputRateLimiter . At OutputRateLimiter , the event output is controlled before sending the events to the stream junction or to the query callback. When the output clause is not defined, the PassThroughOutputRateLimiter is used by passing all the events without any rate limiting.","title":"SingleInputStream Query Runtime (Filter &amp; Windows)"},{"location":"architecture/#temporal-processing-with-windows","text":"The temporal event processing aspect is achieved via Window and AttributeAggregators To achieve temporal processing,Siddhi uses the following four type of events: Current Events : Events that are newly arriving to a query from streams. Expired Events : Events that have expired from a window. Timer Events : Events that inform the query about an update of execution time. These events are usually generated by schedulers. Reset Events : Events that resets the Siddhi query states. In Siddhi, when an event comes into a WindowProcessor , it creates an appropriate expired event corresponding to the incoming current event with the expiring timestamp, and stores that event in the window. The WindowProcessor also forwards the current event to the next processor for further processing. It uses a scheduler or such to determine when to emit the events it has in memory. During that time, it emits these events as expired events. If it needs to emit all the events in the memory at once, it emits a single reset event instead of sending one expired event for each event it has stored, so that it can reset the states in one go. For each current event emitted from a window, a corresponding expired event must be emitted. If not, a common reset event must be emitted. This is vital in Siddhi because Siddhi relies on these events to calculate the Aggregations at the QuerySelector . In the QuerySelector , the arrived current events increase the aggregation values, expired events decrease the values, and reset events reset the aggregation calculation. For example, the sliding TimeWindow creates a corresponding expired event for each current event that arrives, adds that to the window, adds an entry to the scheduler to notify when that event need to be expired by sending it a timer event, and finally sends the current event to the next processor for subsequent processing. When the window receives an indication that the expected expiry time has come for the oldest event in the window via a a timer event or other means, it removes the expired event from the window and passes that to the next processor.","title":"Temporal Processing with Windows"},{"location":"architecture/#joininputstream-query-runtime-join","text":"Join input stream query runtime is generated for join queries. This can consume events from two stream junctions and perform a join operation as depicted above. It can also perform a join by consuming events from one stream junction and join against itself, or it can join against a table, window or an incremental aggregation. When a join is performed with a table, window or incremental aggregation, the WindowProcessor in the image is replaced with the table, window or incremental aggregation. No basic processors are used on their side. The joining operation is triggered by the events that arrive from the stream junction. Here, when an event from one stream reaches the pre JoinProcessor , it matches against all the available events of the other stream's WindowProcessor . When a match is found, those matched events are sent to the QuerySelector as current events, and at the same time, the original event is added to the WindowProcessor where it remains until it expires. Similarly, when an event expires from the WindowProcessor , it matches against all the available events of the other stream's WindowProcessor , and when a match is found, those matched events are sent to the QuerySelector as expired events. Note: Despite the optimizations, a join query is quite expensive when it comes to performance. This is because the WindowProcessor is locked during the matching process to avoid race conditions and to achieve accuracy while joining. Therefore, avoid matching large windows in high volume streams. Based on the scenario, using appropriate window sizes (by time or length) helps to achieve maximum performance.","title":"JoinInputStream Query Runtime (Join)"},{"location":"architecture/#stateinputstream-query-runtime-pattern-sequence","text":"The state input stream query runtime is generated for pattern and sequence queries. This consumes events from one or more stream junctions via ProcessStreamReceivers . A ProcessStreamReceiver and a set of basic processors is defined in the query for each condition. When a ProcessStreamReceiver consumes the events, it updates the states with the incoming events that are generated by previous conditions. If the condition applied is the first condition in the query, then it creates a new state and updates that with the incoming event. This is then passed to basic processors to perform filtering and transformation operations. The states that pass the basic processors are consumed by the PostStateProcessor and stored at the PreStateProcessor of the following pattern or sequence condition. When the state reaches the final condition's PostStateProcessor , the output event is generated and emitted by QuerySelector .","title":"StateInputStream Query Runtime (Pattern &amp; Sequence)"},{"location":"architecture/#siddhi-partition-execution","text":"A partition is a wrapper around one or more Siddhi queries and inner streams that connect them.

The PartitionExecutor of stream receiver evaluates the incoming events to identify the partition key using the RangePartitionExecutor or the ValuePartitionExecutor , and passes the events to the QueryRuntimes of the appropriate PartitionInstanceRuntime based on the partition key. If a PartitionInstanceRuntime is not available for the given partition key, it is dynamically generated via the relevant QueryRuntimes and InnerStreamJunctions . Based on the partition definition, the QueryRuntimes in the PartitionInstanceRuntime wire themselves via inner StreamJunctions or using StreamJunctions outside the partitions. When a partition query consumes a non partitioned global stream, all instances of its QueryRuntime that are part of multiple PartitionInstanceRuntimes receive the same event as depicted in the above diagram.","title":"Siddhi Partition Execution"},{"location":"architecture/#siddhi-event-formats","text":"Siddhi has three event formats. Event This is the format exposed to end users when they send events via Input Handler, and consume events via Stream Callback or Query Callback. This consists of an Object[] that contains all the values in accordance to the corresponding stream. StreamEvent (Subtype of ComplexEvent ) This is used within queries. This contains the following three Object[] s: - beforeWindowData : This contains values that are only used in processors that are executed before the WindowProcessor . - onAfterWindowData : This contains values that are only used by the WindowProcessor and the other processors that follow it, but not sent as output. - outputData : This contains the values that comply with the output stream of the query. In order to optimize the amount of data that is stored in the in-memory at windows, the content in beforeWindowData is cleared before the event enters the WindowProcessor . StreamEvents can also be chained by linking each other via the next property in them. StateEvent (Subtype of ComplexEvent ) This is used in Joins, Patterns and Sequences when we need to associate events of multiple streams, tables, windows and aggregations of different types together. This has a collection of StreamEvents representing different streams, tables, etc, that are used in the query, and outputData to contain the values that are needed for the query output. StreamEvents can also be chained by linking each other with the next property in them.

It performs Stream Processing and Complex Event Processing on real time data streams. Siddhi is used by many companies including Uber and eBay (via Apache Eagle). Uber processes more than 20 billion events per day using Siddhi for fraud analytics, and Siddhi is used in Apache Eagle as a policy enforcement engine. This quick start guide contains the following six sections: Stream Processing and Complex Event Processing Overview - about the domain of Siddhi An Overview of Siddhi - Explaining the basic architecture Using Siddhi for the First Time - how to set up the software Siddhi \u2018Hello World!\u2019 - Your First Siddhi Application Simulating Events - Testing your query with simulated events A Bit of Stream Processing - temporal event processing 1. Stream Processing and Complex Event Processing (CEP) Overview Before diving into using Siddhi, let's first discuss Stream Processing and Complex Event Processing in brief so that we can identify the use-cases where Siddhi can be used. First let's understand what an event is through an example. If we consider the transactions carried out via an ATM as a data stream, one withdrawal from it can be considered an event . This event contains data about the amount, time, account number etc. Many such transactions form a stream. Forrester defines Streaming Analytics as: Software that provides analytical operators to orchestrate data flow , calculate analytics , and detect patterns on event data from multiple, disparate live data sources to allow developers to build applications that sense, think, and act in real time . Gartner\u2019s IT Glossary defines CEP as follows: \"CEP is a kind of computing in which incoming data about events is distilled into more useful, higher level \u201ccomplex\u201d event data that provides insight into what is happening.\" \" CEP is event-driven because the computation is triggered by the receipt of event data. CEP is used for highly demanding, continuous-intelligence applications that enhance situation awareness and support real-time decisions.\" Basically, Siddhi receives data event-by-event and processes them in real time to produce meaningful information. Siddhi Can be used in the following use-cases: Fraud Analytics Monitoring Anomaly Detection Sentiment Analysis Processing Customer Behaviour .. etc 2. Overview of Siddhi As indicated above, Siddhi can: accept event inputs from many different types of sources process them to generate insights publish them to many types of sinks. To use Siddhi, you need to write the processing logic as a Siddhi Application in the Siddhi Streaming SQL language which is discussed in the 4 th section. After writing and starting a Siddhi application , it: Takes data one-by-one as events Processes the data in each event Generates new high level events based on the processing done so far Sends newly generated events as the output to streams. 3. Using Siddhi for the First Time In this section, we will be using the WSO2 Stream Processor(referred to as SP in the rest of this guide)\u200a\u2014\u200aa server version of Siddhi that has a sophisticated editor with a GUI (referred to as \u201cStream Processor Studio\u201d ) where you can write your query and simulate events as a data stream. Step 1 \u200a\u2014\u200aInstall Oracle Java SE Development Kit (JDK) version 1.8. Step 2 \u200a\u2014\u200a Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable. Step 3 \u200a\u2014\u200aDownload the latest WSO2 Stream Processor . Step 4 \u200a\u2014\u200aExtract the downloaded zip and navigate to SP_HOME /bin . ( SP_HOME refers to the extracted folder) Step 5 \u200a\u2014\u200aIssue the following command in the command prompt (Windows) / terminal (Linux) For Windows: editor.bat For Linux: ./editor.sh For more details about WSO2 Stream Processor, see its Quick Start Guide . After successfully starting the Stream Processor Studio, the terminal in Linux should look like as shown below: After starting the WSO2 Stream Processor, access the Stream Processor Studio by visiting the following link in your browser. http://localhost:9390/editor This takes you to the Stream Processor Studio landing page. 4. Siddhi \u2018Hello World!\u2019\u200a\u2014\u200aYour First Siddhi Application Siddhi Streaming SQL is a rich, compact, easy-to-learn SQL-like language. Let's first learn how to find the total of values coming into a data stream and output the current running total value with each event. Siddhi has lot of in-built functions and extensions available for complex analysis, but to get started, let's use a simple one. You can find more information about the Siddhi grammar and its functions in the Siddhi Query Guide . Let's consider a scenario where we are loading cargo boxes into a ship . We need to keep track of the total weight of the cargo added. Measuring the weight of a cargo box when loading is considered an event . We can write a Siddhi program for the above scenario which has 4 parts . Part 1\u200a\u2014\u200aGiving our Siddhi application a suitable name. This is a Siddhi routine. In this example, let's name our application as \u201cHelloWorldApp\u201d @App:name(\"HelloWorldApp\") Part 2\u200a\u2014\u200aDefining the input stream. The stream needs to have a name and a schema defining the data that each incoming event should contain. The event data attributes are expressed as name and type pairs. In this example: The name of the input stream\u200a\u2014\u200a \u201cCargoStream\u201d This contains only one data attribute: The name of the data in each event\u200a\u2014\u200a \u201cweight\u201d Type of the data \u201cweight\u201d \u200a\u2014\u200aint define stream CargoStream (weight int); Part 3 - Defining the output stream. This has the same info as the previous definition with an additional totalWeight attribute that contains the total weight calculated so far. Here, we need to add a \"sink\" to log the OutputStream so that we can observe the output values. ( Sink is the Siddhi way to publish streams to external systems. This particular log type sink just logs the stream events. To learn more about sinks, see sink ) @sink(type='log', prefix='LOGGER') define stream OutputStream(weight int, totalWeight long); Part 4\u200a\u2014\u200aThe actual Siddhi query. Here we need to specify the following: A name for the query\u200a\u2014\u200a \u201cHelloWorldQuery\u201d Which stream should be taken into processing\u200a\u2014\u200a \u201cCargoStream\u201d What data we require in the output stream\u200a\u2014\u200a \u201cweight\u201d , \u201ctotalWeight\u201d How the output should be calculated - by calculating the sum of the the *weight*s Which stream should be populated with the output\u200a\u2014\u200a \u201cOutputStream\u201d @info(name='HelloWorldQuery') from CargoStream select weight, sum(weight) as totalWeight insert into OutputStream; 5. Simulating Events The Stream Processor Studio has in-built support to simulate events. You can do it via the \u201cEvent Simulator\u201d panel at the left of the Stream Processor Studio. You should save your HelloWorldApp by browsing to File - Save before you run event simulation. Then click Event Simulator and configure it as shown below. Step 1\u200a\u2014\u200aConfigurations: Siddhi App Name\u200a\u2014\u200a \u201cHelloWorldApp\u201d Stream Name\u200a\u2014\u200a \u201cCargoStream\u201d Timestamp\u200a\u2014\u200a(Leave it blank) weight\u200a\u2014\u200a2 (or some integer) Step 2\u200a\u2014\u200aClick \u201cRun\u201d mode and then click \u201cStart\u201d . This starts the Siddhi Application. If the Siddhi application is successfully started, the following message is printed in the Stream Processor Studio console: \u201cHelloWorldApp.siddhi Started Successfully!\u201d Step 3\u200a\u2014\u200aClick \u201cSend\u201d and observe the terminal where you started WSO2 Stream Processor Studio. You can see a log that contains \u201coutputData=[2, 2]\u201d . Click Send again and observe a log with \u201coutputData=[2, 4]\u201d . You can change the value of the weight and send it to see how the sum of the weight is updated. Bravo! You have successfully completed creating Siddhi Hello World! 6. A Bit of Stream Processing - temporal event processing This section demonstrates how to carry out temporal window processing with Siddhi. Up to this point, we have been carrying out the processing by having only the running sum value in-memory. No events were stored during this process. Window processing is a method that allows us to store some events in-memory for a given period so that we can perform operations such as calculating the average, maximum, etc values within them. Let's imagine that when we are loading cargo boxes into the ship we need to keep track of the average weight of the recently loaded boxes so that we can balance the weight across the ship. For this purpose, let's try to find the average weight of last three boxes of each event. For window processing, we need to modify our query as follows: @info(name='HelloWorldQuery') from CargoStream#window.length(3) select weight, sum(weight) as totalWeight, avg(weight) as averageWeight insert into OutputStream; from CargoStream#window.length(3) - Here, we are specifying that the last 3 events should be kept in memory for processing. avg(weight) as averageWeight - Here, we are calculating the average of events stored in the window and producing the average value as \"averageWeight\" (Note: Now the sum also calculates the totalWeight based on the last three events). We also need to modify the \"OutputStream\" definition to accommodate the new \"averageWeight\" . define stream OutputStream(weight int, totalWeight long, averageWeight double); The updated Siddhi Application should look as shown below: Now you can send events using the Event Simulator and observe the log to see the sum and average of the weights of the last three cargo events. It is also notable that the defined length window only keeps 3 events in-memory. When the 4 th event arrives, the first event in the window is removed from memory. This ensures that the memory usage does not grow beyond a specific limit. There are also other implementations done in Siddhi to reduce the memory consumption. For more information, see Siddhi Architecture . To learn more about the Siddhi functionality, see Siddhi Query Guide . Feel free to try out Siddhi and event simulation to understand Siddhi better.

Let's first learn how to find the total of values coming into a data stream and output the current running total value with each event. Siddhi has lot of in-built functions and extensions available for complex analysis, but to get started, let's use a simple one. You can find more information about the Siddhi grammar and its functions in the Siddhi Query Guide . Let's consider a scenario where we are loading cargo boxes into a ship .

Simulating Events"},{"location":"quckstart/#6-a-bit-of-stream-processing-temporal-event-processing","text":"This section demonstrates how to carry out temporal window processing with Siddhi. Up to this point, we have been carrying out the processing by having only the running sum value in-memory. No events were stored during this process. Window processing is a method that allows us to store some events in-memory for a given period so that we can perform operations such as calculating the average, maximum, etc values within them. Let's imagine that when we are loading cargo boxes into the ship we need to keep track of the average weight of the recently loaded boxes so that we can balance the weight across the ship. For this purpose, let's try to find the average weight of last three boxes of each event. For window processing, we need to modify our query as follows: @info(name='HelloWorldQuery') from CargoStream#window.length(3) select weight, sum(weight) as totalWeight, avg(weight) as averageWeight insert into OutputStream; from CargoStream#window.length(3) - Here, we are specifying that the last 3 events should be kept in memory for processing. avg(weight) as averageWeight - Here, we are calculating the average of events stored in the window and producing the average value as \"averageWeight\" (Note: Now the sum also calculates the totalWeight based on the last three events). We also need to modify the \"OutputStream\" definition to accommodate the new \"averageWeight\" . define stream OutputStream(weight int, totalWeight long, averageWeight double); The updated Siddhi Application should look as shown below: Now you can send events using the Event Simulator and observe the log to see the sum and average of the weights of the last three cargo events. It is also notable that the defined length window only keeps 3 events in-memory. When the 4 th event arrives, the first event in the window is removed from memory. This ensures that the memory usage does not grow beyond a specific limit. There are also other implementations done in Siddhi to reduce the memory consumption.

A Bit of Stream Processing - temporal event processing"},{"location":"query-guide/","text":"Siddhi 4.x Streaming SQL Guide Introduction Siddhi Streaming SQL is designed to process event streams in a streaming manner, detect complex event occurrences, and notify them in real-time. Siddhi Application Streaming processing and Complex Event Processing rules can be written is Siddhi Streaming SQL and they can be put together as a SiddhiApp in a single file. Purpose Each Siddhi Application is an isolated processing unit that allows you to deploy and execute queries independent of other Siddhi applications in the system. The following diagram depicts how event flows work with some of the key Siddhi Streaming SQL elements The following diagram depicts how event flows work with some of the key Siddhi Streaming SQL elements of the Siddhi Application. Below table provides brief description of a few key elements in the Siddhi Streaming SQL Language. Elements Description Stream A logical series of events ordered in time with a uniquely identifiable name, and set of defined attributes with specific data types defining its schema. Event An event is associated with only one stream, and all events of that stream have an identical set of attributes that are assigned specific types (or the same schema). An event contains a timestamp and set of attribute values according to the schema. Table A structured representation of data stored with a defined schema. Stored data can be backed by In-Memory , RDBMs , MongoDB , etc. to be accessed and manipulated at runtime. Query A logical construct that processes events in streaming manner by combining existing streams and/or tables, and generates events to an output stream or table. A query consumes one or more input streams, and zero or one table. Then it processes these events in a streaming manner and publishes the output events to streams or tables for further processing or to generate notifications. Source A contract that consumes data from external sources (such as TCP , Kafka , HTTP , etc)in the form of events, then converts each event (which can be in XML , JSON , binary , etc. format) to a Siddhi event, and passes that to a Stream for processing. Sink A contract that takes events arriving at a stream, maps them to a predefined data format (such as XML , JSON , binary , etc), and publishes them to external endpoints (such as E-mail , TCP , Kafka , HTTP , etc). Input Handler A mechanism to programmatically inject events into streams. Stream/Query Callback A mechanism to programmatically consume output events from streams and queries. Partition A logical container that isolates the processing of queries based on partition keys. Here, a separate instance of queries is generated for each partition key to achieve isolation. Inner Stream A positionable stream that connects portioned queries within their partitions, preserving isolation. Grammar An element of Siddhi SQL can be composed together as a script in a Siddhi application, Here each construct must be separated by a semicolon ( ; ) as shown in the below syntax. siddhi app : app annotation * ( stream definition | table definition | ... ) + ( query | partition ) + ; Example Siddhi Application named Temperature-Analytics defined with a stream named TempStream and a query named 5minAvgQuery for processing it. @app:name('Temperature-Analytics') define stream TempStream (deviceID long, roomNo int, temp double); @name('5minAvgQuery') from TempStream#window.time(5 min) select roomNo, avg(temp) as avgTemp group by roomNo insert into OutputStream; Stream A stream is a logical series of events ordered in time. Its schema is defined via the stream definition . A stream definition contains a unique name and a set of attributes with specific types and uniquely identifiable names within the stream. All the events that are selected to be received into a specific stream have the same schema (i.e., have the same attributes in the same order). Purpose By defining a schema it unifies common types of events together. This enables them to be processed via queries using their defined attributes in a streaming manner, and allow sinks and sources to map events to/from various data formats. Syntax The syntax for defining a new stream is as follows. define stream stream name ( attribute name attribute type , attribute name attribute type , ... ); The following parameters are configured in a stream definition. Parameter Description stream name The name of the stream created. (It is recommended to define a stream name in PascalCase .) attribute name The schema of an stream is defined by its attributes with uniquely identifiable attribute names. (It is recommended to define attribute names in camelCase .) attribute type The type of each attribute defined in the schema. This can be STRING , INT , LONG , DOUBLE , FLOAT , BOOL or OBJECT . To use and refer stream and attribute names that do not follow [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9]* format enclose them in `. E.g. ``` $test(0)` ```. To make the stream process events in asynchronous and multi-threading manner use the @Async annotation as shown in Threading and Asynchronous configuration section. Example define stream TempStream (deviceID long, roomNo int, temp double); The above creates a stream named TempStream with the following attributes. deviceID of type long roomNo of type int temp of type double Source Sources receive events via multiple transports and in various data formats, and direct them into streams for processing. A source configuration allows you to define a mapping in order to convert each incoming event from its native data format to a Siddhi event. When customizations to such mappings are not provided, Siddhi assumes that the arriving event adheres to the predefined format based on the stream definition and the selected message format. Purpose Source allows Siddhi to consume events from external systems, and map the events to adhere to the associated stream. Syntax To configure a stream that consumes events via a source, add the source configuration to a stream definition by adding the @source annotation with the required parameter values. The source syntax is as follows: @source(type='source_type', static.option.key1='static_option_value1', static.option.keyN='static_option_valueN', @map(type='map_type', static.option_key1='static_option_value1', static.option.keyN='static_option_valueN', @attributes( attributeN='attribute_mapping_N', attribute1='attribute_mapping_1') ) ) define stream StreamName (attribute1 Type1, attributeN TypeN); This syntax includes the following annotations. Source The type parameter of @source defines the source type that receives events. The other parameters to be configured depends on the source type selected, some of the the parameters are optional. For detailed information about the parameters see the documentation for the relevant source. The following is the list of source types that are currently supported: HTTP Kafka TCP In-memory WSO2Event Email JMS File RabbitMQ MQTT WebSocket Twitter Amazon SQS CDC Prometheus Source Mapper Each @source configuration has a mapping denoted by the @map annotation that converts the incoming messages format to Siddhi events. The type parameter of the @map defines the map type to be used to map the data. The other parameters to be configured depends on the mapper selected. Some of these parameters are optional. For detailed information about the parameters see the documentation for the relevant mapper. Tip When the @map annotation is not provided, @map(type='passThrough') is used as default. This default mapper type can be used when source consumes Siddhi events and when it does not need any mappings. Map Attributes @attributes is an optional annotation used with @map to define custom mapping. When @attributes is not provided, each mapper assumes that the incoming events adhere to its own default data format. By adding the @attributes annotation, you can configure mappers to extract data from the incoming message selectively, and assign them to attributes. There are two ways you can configure map attributes. Defining attributes as keys and mapping content as values in the following format: @attributes( attributeN='mapping_N', attribute1='mapping_1') Defining the mapping content of all attributes in the same order as how the attributes are defined in stream definition: @attributes( 'mapping_1', 'mapping_N') Supported Mapping Types The following is a list of currently supported source mapping types: WSO2Event XML TEXT JSON Binary Key Value CSV Avro Example This query receives events via the HTTP source in the JSON data format, and directs them to the InputStream stream for processing. Here the HTTP source is configured to receive events on all network interfaces on the 8080 port, on the foo context, and it is secured via basic authentication. @source(type='http', receiver.url='http://0.0.0.0:8080/foo', basic.auth.enabled='true', @map(type='json')) define stream InputStream (name string, age int, country string); Sink Sinks publish events from the streams via multiple transports to external endpoints in various data formats. A sink configuration allows you to define a mapping to convert the Siddhi event to the required output data format (such as JSON , TEXT , XML , etc.). When customization to such mappings is not provided, Siddhi converts events to its default format based on the stream definition and the selected data format to publish the events. Purpose Sinks provide a way to publish Siddhi events to external systems in the preferred data format. Syntax To configure a stream to publish events via a sink, add the sink configuration to a stream definition by adding the @sink annotation with the required parameter values. The sink syntax is as follows: @sink(type='sink_type', static_option_key1='static_option_value1', dynamic_option_key1='{{dynamic_option_value1}}', @map(type='map_type', static_option_key1='static_option_value1', dynamic_option_key1='{{dynamic_option_value1}}', @payload('payload_mapping') ) ) define stream StreamName (attribute1 Type1, attributeN TypeN); Dynamic Properties The sink and sink mapper properties that are categorized as dynamic have the ability to absorb attributes values from their associated streams. This can be done by using the attribute names in double curly braces as {{...}} when configuring the property value. Some valid dynamic properties values are: '{{attribute1}}' 'This is {{attribute1}}' {{attribute1}} {{attributeN}} Here the attribute names in the double curly braces will be replaced with event values during execution. This syntax includes the following annotations. Sink The type parameter of the @sink annotation defines the sink type that publishes the events. The other parameters to be configured depends on the sink type selected. Some of these parameters are optional, and some can have dynamic values. For detailed information about the parameters see documentation for the relevant sink. The following is a list of currently supported sink types. HTTP Kafka TCP In-memory Log WSO2Event Email JMS File RabbitMQ MQTT WebSocket Amazon SQS Prometheus Distributed Sink Distributed Sinks publish events from a defined stream to multiple destination endpoints using load balancing and partitioning strategies. Any ordinary sink can be used as a distributed sink. A distributed sink configuration allows you to define a common mapping to convert the Siddhi events for all its destination endpoints, allows you to define a distribution strategy (e.g. roundRobin , partitioned ), and configuration for each specific endpoint destination. Purpose Distributed sinks provide a way to publish Siddhi events to multiple destination endpoints in the preferred data format. Syntax To configure a stream to publish events via a distributed sink, add the sink configuration to a stream definition by adding the @sink annotation and add the configuration parameters that are common of all the destination endpoints inside the @sink annotation along with @distribution and @destination annotations providing distribution strategy and endpoint specific configurations. The distributed sink syntax is as follows: RoundRobin Distributed Sink Publishes events to defined destinations in a round robin manner. @sink(type='sink_type', common_option_key1='common_option_value1', common_option_key2='{{common_option_value1}}', @map(type='map_type', option_key1='option_value1', option_key2='{{option_value1}}', @payload('payload_mapping') ) @distribution(strategy='roundRobin', @destination(specific_option_key1='specific_option_value1'), @destination(specific_option_key1='specific_option_value2'))) ) define stream StreamName (attribute1 Type1, attributeN TypeN); Partitioned Distributed Sink Publishes events to defined destinations by partitioning based on the hashcode of the events partition key. @sink(type='sink_type', common_option_key1='common_option_value1', common_option_key2='{{common_option_value1}}', @map(type='map_type', option_key1='option_value1', option_key2='{{option_value1}}', @payload('payload_mapping') ) @distribution(strategy='partitioned', partitionKey='partition_key', @destination(specific_option_key1='specific_option_value1'), @destination(specific_option_key1='specific_option_value2'))) ) define stream StreamName (attribute1 Type1, attributeN TypeN); Sink Mapper Each @sink annotation has a mapping denoted by the @map annotation that converts the Siddhi event to an outgoing message format. The type parameter of the @map annotation defines the map type based on which the event is mapped. The other parameters to be configured depends on the mapper selected. Some of these parameters are optional and some have dynamic values. For detailed information about the parameters see the documentation for the relevant mapping type. Tip When the @map annotation is not provided, @map(type='passThrough') is used by default. This can be used when the sink publishes in the Siddhi event format, or when it does not need any mappings. Map Payload @payload is an optional annotation used with the @map annotation to define a custom mapping. When the @payload annotation is not provided, each mapper maps the outgoing events to its own default data format. By defining the @payload annotation you can configure mappers to produce the output payload with attribute names of your choice, using dynamic properties by selectively assigning the attributes in your preferred format. There are two ways you can configure the @payload annotation. Some mappers such as XML , JSON , and Test accept only one output payload using the following format: @payload( 'This is a test message from {{user}}.' ) Some mappers such key-value accept series of mapping values defined as follows: @payload( key1='mapping_1', 'key2'='user : {{user}}') Here, apart from the dotted key names sush as a.b.c , any constant string value such as '$abc' can also by used as a key. Supported Mapping Types The following is a list of currently supported sink mapping types: WSO2Event XML TEXT JSON Binary Key Value CSV Avro Example Following query publishes events from the OutputStream stream to an HTTP endpoint. Here the events are mapped to the default JSON payloads and sent to http://localhost:8005/endpoint using the POST method, with the Accept header, and secured via basic authentication where admin is both the username and the password. @sink(type='http', publisher.url='http://localhost:8005/endpoint', method='POST', headers='Accept-Date:20/02/2017', basic.auth.username='admin', basic.auth.password='admin', basic.auth.enabled='true', @map(type='json')) define stream OutputStream (name string, ang int, country string); Following query publishes events from the OutputStream stream to multiple the HTTP endpoints using partitioning strategy. Here the events sent to either http://localhost:8005/endpoint1 or http://localhost:8006/endpoint2 based on the partitioning key country . It uses default JSON mapping, POST method, and used admin as both the username and the password when publishing to both the endpoints. @sink(type='http', method='POST', basic.auth.username='admin', basic.auth.password='admin', basic.auth.enabled='true', @map(type='json'), @distribution(strategy='partitioned', partitionKey='country', @destination(publisher.url='http://localhost:8005/endpoint1'), @destination(publisher.url='http://localhost:8006/endpoint2'))) define stream OutputStream (name string, ang int, country string); Query Each Siddhi query can consume one or more streams, and 0-1 tables, process the events in a streaming manner, and then generate an output event to a stream or perform a CRUD operation to a table. Purpose A query enables you to perform complex event processing and stream processing operations by processing incoming events one by one in the order they arrive. Syntax All queries contain an input and an output section. Some also contain a projection section. A simple query with all three sections is as follows. from input stream select attribute name , attribute name , ... insert into output stream/table Example This query included in a Siddhi Application consumes events from the TempStream stream (that is already defined) and outputs the room temperature and the room number to the RoomTempStream stream. Inferred Stream Here, the RoomTempStream is an inferred Stream, which means it can be used as any other defined stream without explicitly defining its stream definition. The definition of the RoomTempStream is inferred from the first query that produces the stream. Query Projection Siddhi queries supports the following for query projections. Action Description Selecting required objects for projection This involves selecting only some of the attributes from the input stream to be inserted into an output stream. E.g., The following query selects only the `roomNo` and `temp` attributes from the `TempStream` stream. from TempStream select roomNo, temp insert into RoomTempStream; Selecting all attributes for projection Selecting all the attributes in an input stream to be inserted into an output stream. This can be done by using asterisk ( * ) or by omitting the `select` statement. E.g., Both the following queries select all the attributes in the `NewTempStream` stream. from TempStream select * insert into NewTempStream; or from TempStream insert into NewTempStream; Renaming attributes This selects attributes from the input streams and inserts them into the output stream with different names. E.g., This query renames `roomNo` to `roomNumber` and `temp` to `temperature`. from TempStream select roomNo as roomNumber, temp as temperature insert into RoomTempStream; Introducing the constant value This adds constant values by assigning it to an attribute using `as`. E.g., This query specifies 'C' to be used as the constant value for `scale` attribute. from TempStream select roomNo, temp, 'C' as scale insert into RoomTempStream; Using mathematical and logical expressions This uses attributes with mathematical and logical expressions in the precedence order given below, and assigns them to the output attribute using `as`. Operator precedence Operator Distribution Example () Scope (cost + tax) * 0.05 IS NULL Null check deviceID is null NOT Logical NOT not (price > 10) * / % Multiplication, division, modulo temp * 9/5 + 32 + - Addition, substraction temp * 9/5 - 32 < < = > >= Comparators: less-than, greater-than-equal, greater-than, less-than-equal totalCost >= price * quantity == != Comparisons: equal, not equal totalCost != price * quantity IN Contains in table roomNo in ServerRoomsTable AND Logical AND temp < 40 and (humidity < 40 or humidity >= 60) OR Logical OR temp < 40 or (humidity < 40 and humidity >= 60) E.g., Converting Celsius to Fahrenheit and identifying rooms with room number between 10 and 15 as server rooms. from TempStream select roomNo, temp * 9/5 + 32 as temp, 'F' as scale, roomNo > 10 and roomNo < 15 as isServerRoom insert into RoomTempStream; Function A function consumes zero, one or more parameters and always produces a result value. It can be used in any location where an attribute can be used. Purpose Functions encapsulates complex execution logic that makes Siddhi applications simple and easy to understand. Function Parameters Functions parameters can be attributes, constant values, results of other functions, results of mathematical or logical expressions or time parameters. Function parameters vary depending on the function being called. Time is a special parameter that can be defined using the integer time value followed by its unit as int unit . Following are the supported unit types. Upon execution, time returns the value in the scale of milliseconds as a long value. Unit Syntax Year year | years Month month | months Week week | weeks Day day | days Hour hour | hours Minutes minute | minutes | min Seconds second | seconds | sec Milliseconds millisecond | milliseconds E.g. Passing 1 hour and 25 minutes to test() function. test(1 hour 25 min) Note Functions, mathematical expressions, and logical expressions can be used in a nested manner. Following are some inbuilt functions shipped with Siddhi, for more functions refer execution extensions . eventTimestamp log UUID default cast convert ifThenElse minimum maximum coalesce instanceOfBoolean instanceOfDouble instanceOfFloat instanceOfInteger instanceOfLong instanceOfString Example The following configuration converts the roomNo to string and adds a messageID to each event using the convert and UUID functions. from TempStream select convert(roomNo, 'string') as roomNo, temp, UUID() as messageID insert into RoomTempStream; Filter Filters are included in queries to filter information from input streams based on a specified condition. Purpose A filter allows you to separate events that match a specific condition as the output, or for further processing. Syntax Filter conditions should be defined in square brackets next to the input stream name as shown below. from input stream [ filter condition ] select attribute name , attribute name , ... insert into output stream Example This query filters all server rooms of which the room number is within the range of 100-210, and having temperature greater than 40 degrees from the TempStream stream, and inserts the results into the HighTempStream stream. from TempStream[(roomNo = 100 and roomNo 210) and temp 40] select roomNo, temp insert into HighTempStream; Window Windows allow you to capture a subset of events based on a specific criterion from an input stream for calculation. Each input stream can only have a maximum of one window. Purpose To create subsets of events within a stream based on time duration, number of events, etc for processing. A window can operate in a sliding or tumbling (batch) manner. Syntax The #window prefix should be inserted next to the relevant stream in order to use a window. Note Filter condition can be applied both before and/or after the window Example If you want to identify the maximum temperature out of the last 10 events, you need to define a length window of 10 events. This window operates in a sliding mode where the following 3 subsets are calculated when a list of 12 events are received in a sequential order. Subset Event Range 1 1-10 2 2-11 3 3-12 The following query finds the maximum temperature out of last 10 events from the TempStream stream, and inserts the results into the MaxTempStream stream. from TempStream#window.length(10) select max(temp) as maxTemp insert into MaxTempStream; If you define the maximum temperature reading out of every 10 events, you need to define a lengthBatch window of 10 events. This window operates as a batch/tumbling mode where the following 3 subsets are calculated when a list of 30 events are received in a sequential order. Subset Event Range 1 1-10 2 11-20 3 21-30 The following query finds the maximum temperature out of every 10 events from the TempStream stream, and inserts the results into the MaxTempStream stream. from TempStream#window.lengthBatch(10) select max(temp) as maxTemp insert into MaxTempStream; Note Similar operations can be done based on time via time windows and timeBatch windows and for others. Code segments such as #window.time(10 min) considers events that arrive during the last 10 minutes in a sliding manner, and the #window.timeBatch(2 min) considers events that arrive every 2 minutes in a tumbling manner. Following are some inbuilt windows shipped with Siddhi. For more window types, see execution extensions . time timeBatch batch timeLength length lengthBatch sort frequent lossyFrequent session cron externalTime externalTimeBatch delay Output event types Projection of the query depends on the output event types such as, current and expired event types. By default all queries produce current events and only queries with windows produce expired events when events expire from the window. You can specify whether the output of a query should be only current events, only expired events or both current and expired events. Note! Controlling the output event types does not alter the execution within the query, and it does not affect the accuracy of the query execution. The following keywords can be used with the output stream to manipulate output. Output event types Description current events Outputs events when incoming events arrive to be processed by the query. This is default when no specific output event type is specified. expired events Outputs events when events expires from the window. all events Outputs events when incoming events arrive to be processed by the query as well as when events expire from the window. The output event type keyword can be used between insert and into as shown in the following example. Example This query delays all events in a stream by 1 minute. from TempStream#window.time(1 min) select * insert expired events into DelayedTempStream Aggregate function Aggregate functions perform aggregate calculations in the query. When a window is defined the aggregation is restricted within that window. If no window is provided aggregation is performed from the start of the Siddhi application. Syntax from input stream #window. window name ( parameter , parameter , ... ) select aggregate function ( parameter , parameter , ... ) as attribute name , attribute2 name , ... insert into output stream ; Aggregate Parameters Aggregate parameters can be attributes, constant values, results of other functions or aggregates, results of mathematical or logical expressions, or time parameters. Aggregate parameters configured in a query depends on the aggregate function being called. Example The following query calculates the average value for the temp attribute of the TempStream stream. This calculation is done for the last 10 minutes in a sliding manner, and the result is output as avgTemp to the AvgTempStream output stream. from TempStream#window.time(10 min) select avg(temp) as avgTemp, roomNo, deviceID insert into AvgTempStream; Following are some inbuilt aggregation functions shipped with Siddhi, for more aggregation functions, see execution extensions . avg sum max min count distinctCount maxForever minForever stdDev Group By Group By allows you to group the aggregate based on specified attributes. Syntax The syntax for the Group By aggregate function is as follows: from input stream #window. window name (...) select aggregate function ( parameter , parameter , ...) as attribute1 name , attribute2 name , ... group by attribute1 name , attribute2 name ... insert into output stream ; Example The following query calculates the average temperature per roomNo and deviceID combination, for events that arrive at the TempStream stream for a sliding time window of 10 minutes. from TempStream#window.time(10 min) select avg(temp) as avgTemp, roomNo, deviceID group by roomNo, deviceID insert into AvgTempStream; Having Having allows you to filter events after processing the select statement. Purpose This allows you to filter the aggregation output. Syntax The syntax for the Having clause is as follows: from input stream #window. window name ( ... ) select aggregate function ( parameter , parameter , ...) as attribute1 name , attribute2 name , ... group by attribute1 name , attribute2 name ... having condition insert into output stream ; Example The following query calculates the average temperature per room for the last 10 minutes, and alerts if it exceeds 30 degrees. from TempStream#window.time(10 min) select avg(temp) as avgTemp, roomNo group by roomNo having avgTemp 30 insert into AlertStream; Order By Order By allows you to order the aggregated result in ascending and/or descending order based on specified attributes. By default ordering will be done in ascending manner. User can use 'desc' keyword to order in descending manner. Syntax The syntax for the Order By clause is as follows: from input stream #window. window name ( ... ) select aggregate function ( parameter , parameter , ...) as attribute1 name , attribute2 name , ... group by attribute1 name , attribute2 name ... having condition order by attribute1 name (asc | desc)?, attribute2 name ( ascend/descend )?, ... insert into output stream ; Example The following query calculates the average temperature per roomNo and deviceID combination for every 10 minutes, and generate output events by ordering them in the ascending order of the room's avgTemp and then by the descending order of roomNo. from TempStream#window.timeBatch(10 min) select avg(temp) as avgTemp, roomNo, deviceID group by roomNo, deviceID order by avgTemp, roomNo desc insert into AvgTempStream; Limit Offset When events are emitted as a batch, offset allows you to offset beginning of the output event batch and limit allows you to limit the number of events in the batch from the defined offset. With this users can specify which set of events need be emitted. Syntax The syntax for the Limit Offset clause is as follows: from input stream #window. window name ( ... ) select aggregate function ( parameter , parameter , ...) as attribute1 name , attribute2 name , ... group by attribute1 name , attribute2 name ... having condition order by attribute1 name (asc | desc)?, attribute2 name ( ascend/descend )?, ... limit positive interger ? offset positive interger ? insert into output stream ; Here both limit and offset are optional where limit by default output all the events and offset by default set to 0 . Example The following query calculates the average temperature per roomNo and deviceID combination, for events that arrive at the TempStream stream for every 10 minutes and emits two events with highest average temperature. from TempStream#window.timeBatch(10 min) select avg(temp) as avgTemp, roomNo, deviceID group by roomNo, deviceID order by avgTemp desc limit 2 insert into HighestAvgTempStream; The following query calculates the average temperature per roomNo and deviceID combination, for events that arrive at the TempStream stream for every 10 minutes and emits third, forth and fifth events when sorted in descending order based on their average temperature. from TempStream#window.timeBatch(10 min) select avg(temp) as avgTemp, roomNo, deviceID group by roomNo, deviceID order by avgTemp desc limit 3 offset 2 insert into HighestAvgTempStream; Join (Stream) Joins allow you to get a combined result from two streams in real-time based on a specified condition. Purpose Streams are stateless. Therefore, in order to join two streams, they need to be connected to a window so that there is a pool of events that can be used for joining. Joins also accept conditions to join the appropriate events from each stream. During the joining process each incoming event of each stream is matched against all the events in the other stream's window based on the given condition, and the output events are generated for all the matching event pairs. Note Join can also be performed with stored data , aggregation or externally defined windows . Syntax The syntax for a join is as follows: from input stream #window. window name ( parameter , ... ) {unidirectional} {as reference } join input stream #window. window name ( parameter , ... ) {unidirectional} {as reference } on join condition select attribute name , attribute name , ... insert into output stream Here, the join condition allows you to match the attributes from both the streams. Unidirectional join operation By default, events arriving at either stream can trigger the joining process. However, if you want to control the join execution, you can add the unidirectional keyword next to a stream in the join definition as depicted in the syntax in order to enable that stream to trigger the join operation. Here, events arriving at other stream only update the window of that stream, and this stream does not trigger the join operation. Note The unidirectional keyword cannot be applied to both the input streams because the default behaviour already allows both streams to trigger the join operation. Example Assuming that the temperature of regulators are updated every minute. Following is a Siddhi App that controls the temperature regulators if they are not already on for all the rooms with a room temperature greater than 30 degrees. define stream TempStream(deviceID long, roomNo int, temp double); define stream RegulatorStream(deviceID long, roomNo int, isOn bool); from TempStream[temp 30.0]#window.time(1 min) as T join RegulatorStream[isOn == false]#window.length(1) as R on T.roomNo == R.roomNo select T.roomNo, R.deviceID, 'start' as action insert into RegulatorActionStream; Supported join types Following are the supported operations of a join clause. Inner join (join) This is the default behaviour of a join operation. join is used as the keyword to join both the streams. The output is generated only if there is a matching event in both the streams. Left outer join The left outer join operation allows you to join two streams to be merged based on a condition. left outer join is used as the keyword to join both the streams. Here, it returns all the events of left stream even if there are no matching events in the right stream by having null values for the attributes of the right stream. Example The following query generates output events for all events from the StockStream stream regardless of whether a matching symbol exists in the TwitterStream stream or not. from StockStream#window.time(1 min) as S left outer join TwitterStream#window.length(1) as T on S.symbol== T.symbol select S.symbol as symbol, T.tweet, S.price insert into outputStream ; Right outer join This is similar to a left outer join. Right outer join is used as the keyword to join both the streams. It returns all the events of the right stream even if there are no matching events in the left stream. Full outer join The full outer join combines the results of left outer join and right outer join. full outer join is used as the keyword to join both the streams. Here, output event are generated for each incoming event even if there are no matching events in the other stream. Example The following query generates output events for all the incoming events of each stream regardless of whether there is a match for the symbol attribute in the other stream or not. from StockStream#window.time(1 min) as S full outer join TwitterStream#window.length(1) as T on S.symbol== T.symbol select S.symbol as symbol, T.tweet, S.price insert into outputStream ; Pattern This is a state machine implementation that allows you to detect patterns in the events that arrive over time. This can correlate events within a single stream or between multiple streams. Purpose Patterns allow you to identify trends in events over a time period. Syntax The following is the syntax for a pattern query: from (every)? event reference = input stream [ filter condition ] - (every)? event reference = input stream [ filter condition ] - ... (within time gap )? select event reference . attribute name , event reference . attribute name , ... insert into output stream | Items| Description | |-------------------|-------------| | - | This is used to indicate an event that should be following another event. The subsequent event does not necessarily have to occur immediately after the preceding event. The condition to be met by the preceding event should be added before the sign, and the condition to be met by the subsequent event should be added after the sign. | | event reference | This allows you to add a reference to the the matching event so that it can be accessed later for further processing. | | (within time gap )? | The within clause is optional. It defines the time duration within which all the matching events should occur. | | every | every is an optional keyword. This defines whether the event matching should be triggered for every event arrival in the specified stream with the matching condition. When this keyword is not used, the matching is carried out only once. | Siddhi also supports pattern matching with counting events and matching events in a logical order such as ( and , or , and not ). These are described in detail further below in this guide. Example This query sends an alert if the temperature of a room increases by 5 degrees within 10 min. from every( e1=TempStream ) - e2=TempStream[ e1.roomNo == roomNo and (e1.temp + 5) = temp ] within 10 min select e1.roomNo, e1.temp as initialTemp, e2.temp as finalTemp insert into AlertStream; Here, the matching process begins for each event in the TempStream stream (because every is used with e1=TempStream ), and if another event arrives within 10 minutes with a value for the temp attribute that is greater than or equal to e1.temp + 5 of the event e1, an output is generated via the AlertStream . Counting Pattern Counting patterns allow you to match multiple events that may have been received for the same matching condition. The number of events matched per condition can be limited via condition postfixes. Syntax Each matching condition can contain a collection of events with the minimum and maximum number of events to be matched as shown in the syntax below. from (every)? event reference = input stream [ filter condition ] ( min count : max count )? - ... (within time gap )? select event reference ([event index])?. attribute name , ... insert into output stream Postfix Description Example n1:n2 This matches n1 to n2 events (including n1 and not more than n2 ). 1:4 matches 1 to 4 events. n: This matches n or more events (including n ). 2: matches 2 or more events. :n This matches up to n events (excluding n ). :5 matches up to 5 events. n This matches exactly n events. 5 matches exactly 5 events. Specific occurrences of the event in a collection can be retrieved by using an event index with its reference. Square brackets can be used to indicate the event index where 1 can be used as the index of the first event and last can be used as the index for the last available event in the event collection. If you provide an index greater then the last event index, the system returns null . The following are some valid examples. e1[3] refers to the 3 rd event. e1[last] refers to the last event. e1[last - 1] refers to the event before the last event. Example The following Siddhi App calculates the temperature difference between two regulator events. define stream TempStream (deviceID long, roomNo int, temp double); define stream RegulatorStream (deviceID long, roomNo int, tempSet double, isOn bool); from every( e1=RegulatorStream) - e2=TempStream[e1.roomNo==roomNo] 1: - e3=RegulatorStream[e1.roomNo==roomNo] select e1.roomNo, e2[0].temp - e2[last].temp as tempDiff insert into TempDiffStream; Logical Patterns Logical patterns match events that arrive in temporal order and correlate them with logical relationships such as and , or and not . Syntax from (every)? (not)? event reference = input stream [ filter condition ] ((and|or) event reference = input stream [ filter condition ])? (within time gap )? - ... select event reference ([event index])?. attribute name , ... insert into output stream Keywords such as and , or , or not can be used to illustrate the logical relationship. Key Word Description and This allows both conditions of and to be matched by two events in any order. or The state succeeds if either condition of or is satisfied. Here the event reference of the other condition is null . not condition1 and condition2 When not is included with and , it identifies the events that match arriving before any event that match . not condition for time period When not is included with for , it allows you to identify a situation where no event that matches condition1 arrives during the specified time period . e.g., from not TemperatureStream[temp 60] for 5 sec . Here the not pattern can be followed by either an and clause or the effective period of not can be concluded after a given time period . Further in Siddhi more than two streams cannot be matched with logical conditions using and , or , or not clauses at this point. Detecting Non-occurring Events Siddhi allows you to detect non-occurring events via multiple combinations of the key words specified above as shown in the table below. In the patterns listed, P* can be either a regular event pattern, an absent event pattern or a logical pattern. Pattern Detected Scenario not A for time period The non-occurrence of event A within time period after system start up. e.g., Generating an alert if a taxi has not reached its destination within 30 minutes, to indicate that the passenger might be in danger. not A for time period and B After system start up, event A does not occur within time period , but event B occurs at some point in time. e.g., Generating an alert if a taxi has not reached its destination within 30 minutes, and the passenger marked that he/she is in danger at some point in time. not A for time period 1 and not B for time period 2 After system start up, event A doess not occur within time period 1 , and event B also does not occur within time period 2 . e.g., Generating an alert if the driver of a taxi has not reached the destination within 30 minutes, and the passenger has not marked himself/herself to be in danger within that same time period. not A for time period or B After system start up, either event A does not occur within time period , or event B occurs at some point in time. e.g., Generating an alert if the taxi has not reached its destination within 30 minutes, or if the passenger has marked that he/she is in danger at some point in time. not A for time period 1 or not B for time period 2 After system start up, either event A does not occur within time period 1 , or event B occurs within time period 2 . e.g., Generating an alert to indicate that the driver is not on an expected route if the taxi has not reached destination A within 20 minutes, or reached destination B within 30 minutes. A \u2192 not B for time period Event B does not occur within time period after the occurrence of event A. e.g., Generating an alert if the taxi has reached its destination, but this was not followed by a payment record. P* \u2192 not A for time period and B After the occurrence of P*, event A does not occur within time period , and event B occurs at some point in time. P* \u2192 not A for time period 1 and not B for time period 2 After the occurrence of P*, event A does not occur within time period 1 , and event B does not occur within time period 2 . P* \u2192 not A for time period or B After the occurrence of P*, either event A does not occur within time period , or event B occurs at some point in time. P* \u2192 not A for time period 1 or not B for time period 2 After the occurrence of P*, either event A does not occur within time period 1 , or event B does not occur within time period 2 . not A for time period \u2192 B Event A does occur within time period after the system start up, but event B occurs after that time period has elapsed. not A for time period and B \u2192 P* Event A does not occur within time period , and event B occurs at some point in time. Then P* occurs after the time period has elapsed, and after B has occurred. not A for time period 1 and not B for time period 2 \u2192 P* After system start up, event A does not occur within time period 1 , and event B does not occur within time period 2 . However, P* occurs after both A and B. not A for time period or B \u2192 P* After system start up, event A does not occur within time period or event B occurs at some point in time. The P* occurs after time period has elapsed, or after B has occurred. not A for time period 1 or not B for time period 2 \u2192 P* After system start up, either event A does not occur within time period 1 , or event B does not occur within time period 2 . Then P* occurs after both time period 1 and time period 2 have elapsed. not A and B Event A does not occur before event B. A and not B Event B does not occur before event A. Example Following Siddhi App, sends the stop control action to the regulator when the key is removed from the hotel room. define stream RegulatorStateChangeStream(deviceID long, roomNo int, tempSet double, action string); define stream RoomKeyStream(deviceID long, roomNo int, action string); from every( e1=RegulatorStateChangeStream[ action == 'on' ] ) - e2=RoomKeyStream[ e1.roomNo == roomNo and action == 'removed' ] or e3=RegulatorStateChangeStream[ e1.roomNo == roomNo and action == 'off'] select e1.roomNo, ifThenElse( e2 is null, 'none', 'stop' ) as action having action != 'none' insert into RegulatorActionStream; This Siddhi Application generates an alert if we have switch off the regulator before the temperature reaches 12 degrees. define stream RegulatorStateChangeStream(deviceID long, roomNo int, tempSet double, action string); define stream TempStream (deviceID long, roomNo int, temp double); from e1=RegulatorStateChangeStream[action == 'start'] - not TempStream[e1.roomNo == roomNo and temp 12] and e2=RegulatorStateChangeStream[action == 'off'] select e1.roomNo as roomNo insert into AlertStream; This Siddhi Application generates an alert if the temperature does not reduce to 12 degrees within 5 minutes of switching on the regulator. define stream RegulatorStateChangeStream(deviceID long, roomNo int, tempSet double, action string); define stream TempStream (deviceID long, roomNo int, temp double); from e1=RegulatorStateChangeStream[action == 'start'] - not TempStream[e1.roomNo == roomNo and temp 12] for '5 min' select e1.roomNo as roomNo insert into AlertStream; Sequence Sequence is a state machine implementation that allows you to detect the sequence of event occurrences over time. Here all matching events need to arrive consecutively to match the sequence condition, and there cannot be any non-matching events arriving within a matching sequence of events. This can correlate events within a single stream or between multiple streams. Purpose This allows you to detect a specified event sequence over a specified time period. Syntax The syntax for a sequence query is as follows: from (every)? event reference = input stream [ filter condition ], event reference = input stream [ filter condition ], ... (within time gap )? select event reference . attribute name , event reference . attribute name , ... insert into output stream Items Description , This represents the immediate next event i.e., when an event that matches the first condition arrives, the event that arrives immediately after it should match the second condition. event reference This allows you to add a reference to the the matching event so that it can be accessed later for further processing. (within time gap )? The within clause is optional. It defines the time duration within which all the matching events should occur. every every is an optional keyword. This defines whether the matching event should be triggered for every event that arrives at the specified stream with the matching condition. When this keyword is not used, the matching is carried out only once. Example This query generates an alert if the increase in the temperature between two consecutive temperature events exceeds one degree. from every e1=TempStream, e2=TempStream[e1.temp + 1 temp] select e1.temp as initialTemp, e2.temp as finalTemp insert into AlertStream; Counting Sequence Counting sequences allow you to match multiple events for the same matching condition. The number of events matched per condition can be limited via condition postfixes such as Counting Patterns , or by using the * , + , and ? operators. The matching events can also be retrieved using event indexes, similar to how it is done in Counting Patterns . Syntax Each matching condition in a sequence can contain a collection of events as shown below. from (every)? event reference = input stream [ filter condition ](+|*|?)?, event reference = input stream [ filter condition ](+|*|?)?, ... (within time gap )? select event reference . attribute name , event reference . attribute name , ... insert into output stream Postfix symbol Required/Optional Description + Optional This matches one or more events to the given condition. * Optional This matches zero or more events to the given condition. ? Optional This matches zero or one events to the given condition. Example This Siddhi application identifies temperature peeks. define stream TempStream(deviceID long, roomNo int, temp double); from every e1=TempStream, e2=TempStream[e1.temp = temp]+, e3=TempStream[e2[last].temp temp] select e1.temp as initialTemp, e2[last].temp as peakTemp insert into PeekTempStream; Logical Sequence Logical sequences identify logical relationships using and , or and not on consecutively arriving events. Syntax The syntax for a logical sequence is as follows: from (every)? (not)? event reference = input stream [ filter condition ] ((and|or) event reference = input stream [ filter condition ])? (within time gap )?, ... select event reference ([event index])?. attribute name , ... insert into output stream Keywords such as and , or , or not can be used to illustrate the logical relationship, similar to how it is done in Logical Patterns . Example This Siddhi application notifies the state when a regulator event is immediately followed by both temperature and humidity events. define stream TempStream(deviceID long, temp double); define stream HumidStream(deviceID long, humid double); define stream RegulatorStream(deviceID long, isOn bool); from every e1=RegulatorStream, e2=TempStream and e3=HumidStream select e2.temp, e3.humid insert into StateNotificationStream; Output rate limiting Output rate limiting allows queries to output events periodically based on a specified condition. Purpose This allows you to limit the output to avoid overloading the subsequent executions, and to remove unnecessary information. Syntax The syntax of an output rate limiting configuration is as follows: from input stream ... select attribute name , attribute name , ... output rate limiting configuration insert into output stream Siddhi supports three types of output rate limiting configurations as explained in the following table: Rate limiting configuration Syntax Description Based on time output event every time interval This outputs output event every time interval time interval. Based on number of events output event every event interval events This outputs output event for every event interval number of events. Snapshot based output snapshot every time interval This outputs all events in the window (or the last event if no window is defined in the query) for every given time interval time interval. Here the output event specifies the event(s) that should be returned as the output of the query. The possible values are as follows: * first : Only the first event processed by the query during the specified time interval/sliding window is emitted. * last : Only the last event processed by the query during the specified time interval/sliding window is emitted. * all : All the events processed by the query during the specified time interval/sliding window are emitted. When no output event is defined, all is used by default. Examples Returning events based on the number of events Here, events are emitted every time the specified number of events arrive. You can also specify whether to emit only the first event/last event, or all the events out of the events that arrived. In this example, the last temperature per sensor is emitted for every 10 events. from TempStreamselect select temp, deviceID group by deviceID output last every 10 events insert into LowRateTempStream; Returning events based on time Here events are emitted for every predefined time interval. You can also specify whether to emit only the first event, last event, or all events out of the events that arrived during the specified time interval. In this example, emits all temperature events every 10 seconds from TempStreamoutput output every 10 sec insert into LowRateTempStream; Returning a periodic snapshot of events This method works best with windows. When an input stream is connected to a window, snapshot rate limiting emits all the current events that have arrived and do not have corresponding expired events for every predefined time interval. If the input stream is not connected to a window, only the last current event for each predefined time interval is emitted. This query emits a snapshot of the events in a time window of 5 seconds every 1 second. from TempStream#window.time(5 sec) output snapshot every 1 sec insert into SnapshotTempStream; Partition Partitions divide streams and queries into isolated groups in order to process them in parallel and in isolation. A partition can contain one or more queries and there can be multiple instances where the same queries and streams are replicated for each partition. Each partition is tagged with a partition key. Those partitions only process the events that match the corresponding partition key. Purpose Partitions allow you to process the events groups in isolation so that event processing can be performed using the same set of queries for each group. Partition key generation A partition key can be generated in the following two methods: Partition by value This is created by generating unique values using input stream attributes. Syntax partition with ( expression of stream name , expression of stream name , ... ) begin query query ... end; Example This query calculates the maximum temperature recorded within the last 10 events per deviceID . partition with ( deviceID of TempStream ) begin from TempStream#window.length(10) select roomNo, deviceID, max(temp) as maxTemp insert into DeviceTempStream; end; Partition by range This is created by mapping each partition key to a range condition of the input streams numerical attribute. Syntax partition with ( condition as partition key or condition as partition key or ... of stream name , ... ) begin query query ... end; Example This query calculates the average temperature for the last 10 minutes per office area. partition with ( roomNo = 1030 as 'serverRoom' or roomNo 1030 and roomNo = 330 as 'officeRoom' or roomNo 330 as 'lobby' of TempStream) begin from TempStream#window.time(10 min) select roomNo, deviceID, avg(temp) as avgTemp insert into AreaTempStream end; Inner Stream Queries inside a partition block can use inner streams to communicate with each other while preserving partition isolation. Inner streams are denoted by a \"#\" placed before the stream name, and these streams cannot be accessed outside a partition block. Purpose Inner streams allow you to connect queries within the partition block so that the output of a query can be used as an input only by another query within the same partition. Therefore, you do not need to repartition the streams if they are communicating within the partition. Example This partition calculates the average temperature of every 10 events for each sensor, and sends an output to the DeviceTempIncreasingStream stream if the consecutive average temperature values increase by more than 5 degrees. partition with ( deviceID of TempStream ) begin from TempStream#window.lengthBatch(10) select roomNo, deviceID, avg(temp) as avgTemp insert into #AvgTempStream from every (e1=#AvgTempStream),e2=#AvgTempStream[e1.avgTemp + 5 < avgTemp] select e1.deviceID, e1.avgTemp as initialAvgTemp, e2.avgTemp as finalAvgTemp insert into DeviceTempIncreasingStream end; Table A table is a stored version of an stream or a table of events. Its schema is defined via the table definition that is similar to a stream definition. These events are by default stored in-memory , but Siddhi also provides store extensions to work with data/events stored in various data stores through the table abstraction. Purpose Tables allow Siddhi to work with stored events. By defining a schema for tables Siddhi enables them to be processed by queries using their defined attributes with the streaming data. You can also interactively query the state of the stored events in the table. Syntax The syntax for a new table definition is as follows: define table table name ( attribute name attribute type , attribute name attribute type , ... ); The following parameters are configured in a table definition: Parameter Description table name The name of the table defined. ( PascalCase is used for table name as a convention.) attribute name The schema of the table is defined by its attributes with uniquely identifiable attribute names ( camelCase is used for attribute names as a convention.) attribute type The type of each attribute defined in the schema. This can be STRING , INT , LONG , DOUBLE , FLOAT , BOOL or OBJECT . Example The following defines a table named RoomTypeTable with roomNo and type attributes of data types int and string respectively. define table RoomTypeTable ( roomNo int, type string ); Primary Keys Tables can be configured with primary keys to avoid the duplication of data. Primary keys are configured by including the @PrimaryKey( 'key1', 'key2' ) annotation to the table definition. Each event table configuration can have only one @PrimaryKey annotation. The number of attributes supported differ based on the table implementations. When more than one attribute is used for the primary key, the uniqueness of the events stored in the table is determined based on the combination of values for those attributes. Examples This query creates an event table with the symbol attribute as the primary key. Therefore each entry in this table must have a unique value for symbol attribute. @PrimaryKey('symbol') define table StockTable (symbol string, price float, volume long); Indexes Indexes allow tables to be searched/modified much faster. Indexes are configured by including the @Index( 'key1', 'key2' ) annotation to the table definition. Each event table configuration can have 0-1 @Index annotations. Support for the @Index annotation and the number of attributes supported differ based on the table implementations. When more then one attribute is used for index, each one of them is used to index the table for fast access of the data. Indexes can be configured together with primary keys. Examples This query creates an indexed event table named RoomTypeTable with the roomNo attribute as the index key. @Index('roomNo') define table RoomTypeTable (roomNo int, type string); Store Store is a table that refers to data/events stored in data stores outside of Siddhi such as RDBMS, Cassandra, etc. Store is defined via the @store annotation, and the store schema is defined via a table definition associated with it. Purpose Store allows Siddhi to search, retrieve and manipulate data stored in external data stores through Siddhi queries. Syntax The syntax for a defining store and it's associated table definition is as follows: @store(type='store_type', static.option.key1='static_option_value1', static.option.keyN='static_option_valueN') define table TableName (attribute1 Type1, attributeN TypeN); Example The following defines a RDBMS data store pointing to a MySQL database with name hotel hosted in loacalhost:3306 having a table RoomTypeTable with columns roomNo of INTEGER and type of VARCHAR(255) mapped to Siddhi data types int and string respectively. @Store(type=\"rdbms\", jdbc.url=\"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/hotel\", username=\"siddhi\", password=\"123\", jdbc.driver.name=\"com.mysql.jdbc.Driver\") define table RoomTypeTable ( roomNo int, type string ); Supported Store Types The following is a list of currently supported store types: RDBMS (MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, DB2, H2) Solr MongoDB HBase Redis Cassandra Operators on Table (and Store) The following operators can be performed on tables (and stores). Insert This allows events to be inserted into tables. This is similar to inserting events into streams. Warning If the table is defined with primary keys, and if you insert duplicate data, primary key constrain violations can occur. In such cases use the update or insert into operation. Syntax from input stream select attribute name , attribute name , ... insert into table Similar to streams, you need to use the current events , expired events or the all events keyword between insert and into keywords in order to insert only the specific output event types. For more information, see output event type Example This query inserts all the events from the TempStream stream to the TempTable table. from TempStream select * insert into TempTable; Join (Table) This allows a stream to retrieve information from a table in a streaming manner. Note Joins can also be performed with two streams , aggregation or against externally defined windows . Syntax from input stream join table on condition select ( input stream | table ). attribute name , ( input stream | table ). attribute name , ... insert into output stream Note A table can only be joint with a stream. Two tables cannot be joint because there must be at least one active entity to trigger the join operation. Example This Siddhi App performs a join to retrieve the room type from RoomTypeTable table based on the room number, so that it can filter the events related to server-room s. define table RoomTypeTable (roomNo int, type string); define stream TempStream (deviceID long, roomNo int, temp double); from TempStream join RoomTypeTable on RoomTypeTable.roomNo == TempStream.roomNo select deviceID, RoomTypeTable.type as roomType, type, temp having roomType == 'server-room' insert into ServerRoomTempStream; Supported join types Table join supports following join operations. Inner join (join) This is the default behaviour of a join operation. join is used as the keyword to join the stream with the table. The output is generated only if there is a matching event in both the stream and the table. Left outer join The left outer join operation allows you to join a stream on left side with a table on the right side based on a condition. Here, it returns all the events of left stream even if there are no matching events in the right table by having null values for the attributes of the right table. Right outer join This is similar to a left outer join . right outer join is used as the keyword to join a stream on right side with a table on the left side based on a condition. It returns all the events of the right stream even if there are no matching events in the left table. Delete To delete selected events that are stored in a table. Syntax from input stream select attribute name , attribute name , ... delete table (for output event type )? on condition The condition element specifies the basis on which events are selected to be deleted. When specifying the condition, table attributes should be referred to with the table name. To execute delete for specific output event types, use the current events , expired events or the all events keyword with for as shown in the syntax. For more information, see output event type Note Table attributes must be always referred to with the table name as follows: table name . attibute name Example In this example, the script deletes a record in the RoomTypeTable table if it has a value for the roomNo attribute that matches the value for the roomNumber attribute of an event in the DeleteStream stream. define table RoomTypeTable (roomNo int, type string); define stream DeleteStream (roomNumber int); from DeleteStream delete RoomTypeTable on RoomTypeTable.roomNo == roomNumber; Update This operator updates selected event attributes stored in a table based on a condition. Syntax from input stream select attribute name , attribute name , ... update table (for output event type )? set table . attribute name = ( attribute name | expression )?, table . attribute name = ( attribute name | expression )?, ... on condition The condition element specifies the basis on which events are selected to be updated. When specifying the condition , table attributes must be referred to with the table name. You can use the set keyword to update selected attributes from the table. Here, for each assignment, the attribute specified in the left must be the table attribute, and the one specified in the right can be a stream/table attribute a mathematical operation, or other. When the set clause is not provided, all the attributes in the table are updated. To execute an update for specific output event types use the current events , expired events or the all events keyword with for as shown in the syntax. For more information, see output event type . Note Table attributes must be always referred to with the table name as shown below: table name . attibute name . Example This Siddhi application updates the room occupancy in the RoomOccupancyTable table for each room number based on new arrivals and exits from the UpdateStream stream. define table RoomOccupancyTable (roomNo int, people int); define stream UpdateStream (roomNumber int, arrival int, exit int); from UpdateStream select * update RoomOccupancyTable set RoomOccupancyTable.people = RoomOccupancyTable.people + arrival - exit on RoomOccupancyTable.roomNo == roomNumber; Update or Insert This allows you update if the event attributes already exist in the table based on a condition, or else insert the entry as a new attribute. Syntax from input stream select attribute name , attribute name , ... update or insert into table (for output event type )? set table . attribute name = expression , table . attribute name = expression , ... on condition The condition element specifies the basis on which events are selected for update. When specifying the condition , table attributes should be referred to with the table name. If a record that matches the condition does not already exist in the table, the arriving event is inserted into the table. The set clause is only used when an update is performed during the insert/update operation. When set clause is used, the attribute to the left is always a table attribute, and the attribute to the right can be a stream/table attribute, mathematical operation or other. The attribute to the left (i.e., the attribute in the event table) is updated with the value of the attribute to the right if the given condition is met. When the set clause is not provided, all the attributes in the table are updated. Note When the attribute to the right is a table attribute, the operations supported differ based on the database type. To execute update upon specific output event types use the current events , expired events or the all events keyword with for as shown in the syntax. To understand more see output event type . Note Table attributes should be always referred to with the table name as table name . attibute name . Example The following query update for events in the UpdateTable event table that have room numbers that match the same in the UpdateStream stream. When such events are found in the event table, they are updated. When a room number available in the stream is not found in the event table, it is inserted from the stream. define table RoomAssigneeTable (roomNo int, type string, assignee string); define stream RoomAssigneeStream (roomNumber int, type string, assignee string); from RoomAssigneeStream select roomNumber as roomNo, type, assignee update or insert into RoomAssigneeTable set RoomAssigneeTable.assignee = assignee on RoomAssigneeTable.roomNo == roomNo; In This allows the stream to check whether the expected value exists in the table as a part of a conditional operation. Syntax from input stream [ condition in table ] select attribute name , attribute name , ... insert into output stream The condition element specifies the basis on which events are selected to be compared. When constructing the condition , the table attribute must be always referred to with the table name as shown below: table . attibute name . Example This Siddhi application filters only room numbers that are listed in the ServerRoomTable table. define table ServerRoomTable (roomNo int); define stream TempStream (deviceID long, roomNo int, temp double); from TempStream[ServerRoomTable.roomNo == roomNo in ServerRoomTable] insert into ServerRoomTempStream; Incremental Aggregation Incremental aggregation allows you to obtain aggregates in an incremental manner for a specified set of time periods. This not only allows you to calculate aggregations with varied time granularity, but also allows you to access them in an interactive manner for reports, dashboards, and for further processing. Its schema is defined via the aggregation definition . Incremental aggregation granularity data holders are automatically purged every 15 minutes. When carrying out data purging, the retention period you have specified for each granularity in the incremental aggregation query is taken into account. The retention period defined for a granularity needs to be greater than or equal to its minimum retention period as specified in the table below. If no valid retention period is defined for a granularity, the default retention period (as specified in the table below) is applied. Granularity Default retention Minimum retention second 120 seconds 120 seconds minute 24 hours 120 minutes hour 30 days 25 hours day 1 year 32 days month All 13 month year All none Purpose Incremental aggregation allows you to retrieve the aggregate values for different time durations. That is, it allows you to obtain aggregates such as sum , count , avg , min , max , count and distinctCount of stream attributes for durations such as sec , min , hour , etc. This is of considerable importance in many Analytics scenarios because aggregate values are often needed for several time periods. Furthermore, this ensures that the aggregations are not lost due to unexpected system failures because aggregates can be stored in different persistence stores . Syntax @store(type=\" store type \", ...) @purge(enable=\" true or false \",interval= purging interval ,@retentionPeriod( granularity = retention period , ...) ) define aggregation aggregator name from input stream select attribute name , aggregate function ( attribute name ) as attribute name , ... group by attribute name aggregate by timestamp attribute every time periods ; The above syntax includes the following: Item Description @BufferSize DEPRECIATED FROM V4.2.0 . This identifies the number of expired events to retain in a buffer in order to handle out of order event processing. This is an optional parameter that is applicable only if aggregation is based on external timestamps (because events aggregated based on event arrival time cannot be out of order). Siddhi determines whether an event is expired or not based on the timestamp of the latest event and the most granular duration for which aggregation is calculated. e.g., If the aggregation is calculated for sec\u2026year , the most granular duration is seconds. Therefore, if the buffer size is 3 and events arrive during 51 st , 52 nd , 53 rd and 54 th seconds, all of the older aggregations (i.e., for 51 st , 52 nd and 53 rd seconds) are kept in the buffer because the latest event arrived during the 54 th second. The default value is 0 . @IgnoreEventsOlderThanBuffer DEPRECIATED FROM V4.2.0 .This annotation specifies whether or not to aggregate events older than the buffer. If this parameter is set to false (which is default), any event older than the buffer is aggregated with the oldest event in buffer. If this parameter is set to true , any event older than the buffer is dropped. This is an optional annotation. @store This annotation is used to refer to the data store where the calculated aggregate results are stored. This annotation is optional. When no annotation is provided, the data is stored in the in-memory store. @purge This annotation is used to configure purging in aggregation granularities. If this annotation is not provided, the default purging mentioned above is applied. If you want to disable automatic data purging, you can use this annotation as follows: '@purge(enable=false) /You should disable data purging if the aggregation query in included in the Siddhi application for read-only purposes. @retentionPeriod This annotation is used to specify the length of time the data needs to be retained when carrying out data purging. If this annotation is not provided, the default retention period is applied. aggregator name This specifies a unique name for the aggregation so that it can be referred when accessing aggregate results. input stream The stream that feeds the aggregation. Note! this stream should be already defined. group by attribute name The group by clause is optional. If it is included in a Siddhi application, aggregate values are calculated per each group by attribute. If it is not used, all the events are aggregated together. by timestamp attribute This clause is optional. This defines the attribute that should be used as the timestamp. If this clause is not used, the event time is used by default. The timestamp could be given as either a string or a long value. If it is a long value, the unix timestamp in milliseconds is expected (e.g. 1496289950000 ). If it is a string value, the supported formats are yyyy - MM - dd HH : mm : ss (if time is in GMT) and yyyy - MM - dd HH : mm : ss Z (if time is not in GMT), here the ISO 8601 UTC offset must be provided for Z . (e.g., +05:30 , -11:00 ). time periods Time periods can be specified as a range where the minimum and the maximum value are separated by three dots, or as comma-separated values. e.g., A range can be specified as sec...year where aggregation is done per second, minute, hour, day, month and year. Comma-separated values can be specified as min, hour. Skipping time durations (e.g., min, day where the hour duration is skipped) when specifying comma-separated values is supported only from v4.1.1 onwards Note From V4.2.0 onwards, aggregation is carried out at calendar start times for each granularity with the GMT timezone Note From V4.2.6 onwards, the same aggregation can be defined in multiple Siddhi apps for joining, however, only one siddhi app should carry out the processing (i.e. the aggregation input stream should only feed events to one aggregation definition). Example This Siddhi Application defines an aggregation named TradeAggregation to calculate the average and sum for the price attribute of events arriving at the TradeStream stream. These aggregates are calculated per every time granularity in the second-year range. define stream TradeStream (symbol string, price double, volume long, timestamp long); @purge(enable='true', interval='10 sec',@retentionPeriod(sec='120 sec',min='24 hours',hours='30 days',days='1 year',months='all',years='all')) define aggregation TradeAggregation from TradeStream select symbol, avg(price) as avgPrice, sum(price) as total group by symbol aggregate by timestamp every sec ... year; Distributed Aggregation Note Distributed Aggregation is only supported after v4.3.0 Distributed Aggregation allows you to partially process aggregations in different shards. This allows Siddhi app in one shard to be responsible only for processing a part of the aggregation. However for this, all aggregations must be based on a common physical database(@store). Syntax @store(type=\" store type \", ...) @PartitionById define aggregation aggregator name from input stream select attribute name , aggregate function ( attribute name ) as attribute name , ... group by attribute name aggregate by timestamp attribute every time periods ; Following table includes the annotation to be used to enable distributed aggregation, Item Description @PartitionById If the annotation is given, then the distributed aggregation is enabled. Further this can be disabled by using enable element, @PartitionById(enable='false') . Further, following system properties are also available, System Property Description Possible Values Optional Default Value shardId The id of the shard one of the distributed aggregation is running in. This should be unique to a single shard Any string No partitionById This allows user to enable/disable distributed aggregation for all aggregations running in one siddhi manager .(Available from v4.3.3) true/false Yesio false Note ShardIds should not be changed after the first configuration in order to keep data consistency. Join (Aggregation) This allows a stream to retrieve calculated aggregate values from the aggregation. Note A join can also be performed with two streams , with a table and a stream, or with a stream against externally defined windows . Syntax A join with aggregation is similer to the join with table , but with additional within and per clauses. from input stream join aggrigation on join condition within time range per time granularity select attribute name , attribute name , ... insert into output stream ; Apart from constructs of table join this includes the following. Please note that the 'on' condition is optional : Item Description within time range This allows you to specify the time interval for which the aggregate values need to be retrieved. This can be specified by providing the start and end time separated by a comma as string or long values, or by using the wildcard string specifying the data range. For details refer examples. per time granularity This specifies the time granularity by which the aggregate values must be grouped and returned. e.g., If you specify days , the retrieved aggregate values are grouped for each day within the selected time interval. AGG_TIMESTAMP This specifies the start time of the aggregations and can be used in the select clause. within and per clauses also accept attribute values from the stream. Note The timestamp of the aggregations can be accessed through the AGG_TIMESTAMP attribute. Example Following aggregation definition will be used for the examples. define stream TradeStream (symbol string, price double, volume long, timestamp long); define aggregation TradeAggregation from TradeStream select AGG_TIMESTAMP, symbol, avg(price) as avgPrice, sum(price) as total group by symbol aggregate by timestamp every sec ... year; This query retrieves daily aggregations within the time range \"2014-02-15 00:00:00 +05:30\", \"2014-03-16 00:00:00 +05:30\" (Please note that +05:30 can be omitted if timezone is GMT) define stream StockStream (symbol string, value int); from StockStream as S join TradeAggregation as T on S.symbol == T.symbol within \"2014-02-15 00:00:00 +05:30\", \"2014-03-16 00:00:00 +05:30\" per \"days\" select S.symbol, T.total, T.avgPrice insert into AggregateStockStream; This query retrieves hourly aggregations within the day 2014-02-15 . define stream StockStream (symbol string, value int); from StockStream as S join TradeAggregation as T on S.symbol == T.symbol within \"2014-02-15 **:**:** +05:30\" per \"hours\" select S.symbol, T.total, T.avgPrice insert into AggregateStockStream; This query retrieves all aggregations per perValue stream attribute within the time period between timestamps 1496200000000 and 1596434876000 . define stream StockStream (symbol string, value int, perValue string); from StockStream as S join TradeAggregation as T on S.symbol == T.symbol within 1496200000000L, 1596434876000L per S.perValue select S.symbol, T.total, T.avgPrice insert into AggregateStockStream; Supported join types Aggregation join supports following join operations. Inner join (join) This is the default behaviour of a join operation. join is used as the keyword to join the stream with the aggregation. The output is generated only if there is a matching event in the stream and the aggregation. Left outer join The left outer join operation allows you to join a stream on left side with a aggregation on the right side based on a condition. Here, it returns all the events of left stream even if there are no matching events in the right aggregation by having null values for the attributes of the right aggregation. Right outer join This is similar to a left outer join . right outer join is used as the keyword to join a stream on right side with a aggregation on the left side based on a condition. It returns all the events of the right stream even if there are no matching events in the left aggregation. (Defined) Window A defined window is a window that can be shared across multiple queries. Events can be inserted to a defined window from one or more queries and it can produce output events based on the defined window type. Syntax The syntax for a defined window is as follows: define window window name ( attribute name attribute type , attribute name attribute type , ... ) window type ( parameter , parameter , \u2026) output event type ; The following parameters are configured in a table definition: Parameter Description window name The name of the window defined. ( PascalCase is used for window names as a convention.) attribute name The schema of the window is defined by its attributes with uniquely identifiable attribute names ( camelCase is used for attribute names as a convention.) attribute type The type of each attribute defined in the schema. This can be STRING , INT , LONG , DOUBLE , FLOAT , BOOL or OBJECT . window type ( parameter , ...) The window type associated with the window and its parameters. output output event type This is optional. Keywords such as current events , expired events and all events (the default) can be used to specify when the window output should be exposed. For more information, see output event type . Examples Returning all output when events arrive and when events expire from the window. In this query, the output event type is not specified. Therefore, it returns both current and expired events as the output. define window SensorWindow (name string, value float, roomNo int, deviceID string) timeBatch(1 second); + Returning an output only when events expire from the window. In this query, the output event type of the window is `expired events`. Therefore, it only returns the events that have expired from the window as the output. define window SensorWindow (name string, value float, roomNo int, deviceID string) timeBatch(1 second) output expired events; Operators on Defined Windows The following operators can be performed on defined windows. Insert This allows events to be inserted into windows. This is similar to inserting events into streams. Syntax from input stream select attribute name , attribute name , ... insert into window To insert only events of a specific output event type, add the current events , expired events or the all events keyword between insert and into keywords (similar to how it is done for streams). For more information, see output event type . Example This query inserts all events from the TempStream stream to the OneMinTempWindow window. define stream TempStream(tempId string, temp double); define window OneMinTempWindow(tempId string, temp double) time(1 min); from TempStream select * insert into OneMinTempWindow; Join (Window) To allow a stream to retrieve information from a window based on a condition. Note A join can also be performed with two streams , aggregation or with tables tables . Syntax from input stream join window on condition select ( input stream | window ). attribute name , ( input stream | window ). attribute name , ... insert into output stream Example This Siddhi Application performs a join count the number of temperature events having more then 40 degrees within the last 2 minutes. define window TwoMinTempWindow (roomNo int, temp double) time(2 min); define stream CheckStream (requestId string); from CheckStream as C join TwoMinTempWindow as T on T.temp 40 select requestId, count(T.temp) as count insert into HighTempCountStream; Supported join types Window join supports following operations of a join clause. Inner join (join) This is the default behaviour of a join operation. join is used as the keyword to join two windows or a stream with a window. The output is generated only if there is a matching event in both stream/window. Left outer join The left outer join operation allows you to join two windows or a stream with a window to be merged based on a condition. Here, it returns all the events of left stream/window even if there are no matching events in the right stream/window by having null values for the attributes of the right stream/window. Right outer join This is similar to a left outer join. Right outer join is used as the keyword to join two windows or a stream with a window. It returns all the events of the right stream/window even if there are no matching events in the left stream/window. Full outer join The full outer join combines the results of left outer join and right outer join . full outer join is used as the keyword to join two windows or a stream with a window. Here, output event are generated for each incoming event even if there are no matching events in the other stream/window. From A window can be an input to a query, similar to streams. Note !!! When window is used as an input to a query, another window cannot be applied on top of this. Syntax from window select attribute name , attribute name , ... insert into output stream Example This Siddhi Application calculates the maximum temperature within the last 5 minutes. define window FiveMinTempWindow (roomNo int, temp double) time(5 min); from FiveMinTempWindow select max(temp) as maxValue, roomNo insert into MaxSensorReadingStream; Trigger Triggers allow events to be periodically generated. Trigger definition can be used to define a trigger. A trigger also works like a stream with a predefined schema. Purpose For some use cases the system should be able to periodically generate events based on a specified time interval to perform some periodic executions. A trigger can be performed for a 'start' operation, for a given time interval , or for a given ' cron expression ' . Syntax The syntax for a trigger definition is as follows. define trigger trigger name at ('start'| every time interval | ' cron expression '); Similar to streams, triggers can be used as inputs. They adhere to the following stream definition and produce the triggered_time attribute of the long type. define stream trigger name (triggered_time long); The following types of triggeres are currently supported: Trigger type Description 'start' An event is triggered when Siddhi is started. every time interval An event is triggered periodically at the given time interval. ' cron expression ' An event is triggered periodically based on the given cron expression. For configuration details, see quartz-scheduler . Examples Triggering events regularly at specific time intervals The following query triggers events every 5 minutes. define trigger FiveMinTriggerStream at every 5 min; Triggering events at a specific time on specified days The following query triggers an event at 10.15 AM on every weekdays. define trigger FiveMinTriggerStream at '0 15 10 ? * MON-FRI'; Script Scripts allow you to write functions in other programming languages and execute them within Siddhi queries. Functions defined via scripts can be accessed in queries similar to any other inbuilt function. Function definitions can be used to define these scripts. Function parameters are passed into the function logic as Object[] and with the name data . Purpose Scripts allow you to define a function operation that is not provided in Siddhi core or its extension. It is not required to write an extension to define the function logic. Syntax The syntax for a Script definition is as follows. define function function name [ language name ] return return type { operation of the function }; The following parameters are configured when defining a script. Parameter Description function name The name of the function ( camelCase is used for the function name) as a convention. language name The name of the programming language used to define the script, such as javascript , r and scala . return type The attribute type of the function\u2019s return. This can be int , long , float , double , string , bool or object . Here the function implementer should be responsible for returning the output attribute on the defined return type for proper functionality. operation of the function Here, the execution logic of the function is added. This logic should be written in the language specified under the language name , and it should return the output in the data type specified via the return type parameter. Examples This query performs concatenation using JavaScript, and returns the output as a string. define function concatFn[javascript] return string { var str1 = data[0]; var str2 = data[1]; var str3 = data[2]; var responce = str1 + str2 + str3; return responce; }; define stream TempStream(deviceID long, roomNo int, temp double); from TempStream select concatFn(roomNo,'-',deviceID) as id, temp insert into DeviceTempStream; Store Query Siddhi store queries are a set of on-demand queries that can be used to perform operations on Siddhi tables, windows, and aggregators. Purpose Store queries allow you to execute the following operations on Siddhi tables, windows, and aggregators without the intervention of streams. Queries supported for tables: SELECT INSERT DELETE UPDATE UPDATE OR INSERT Queries supported for windows and aggregators: SELECT This is be done by submitting the store query to the Siddhi application runtime using its query() method. In order to execute store queries, the Siddhi application of the Siddhi application runtime you are using, should have a store defined, which contains the table that needs to be queried. Example If you need to query the table named RoomTypeTable the it should have been defined in the Siddhi application. In order to execute a store query on RoomTypeTable , you need to submit the store query using query() method of SiddhiAppRuntime instance as below. siddhiAppRuntime.query( store query ); (Table/Window) Select The SELECT store query retrieves records from the specified table or window, based on the given condition. Syntax from table/window on condition ? select attribute name , attribute name , ... group by ? having ? order by ? limit ? Example This query retrieves room numbers and types of the rooms starting from room no 10. from roomTypeTable on roomNo = 10; select roomNo, type (Aggregation) Select The SELECT store query retrieves records from the specified aggregation, based on the given condition, time range, and granularity. Syntax from aggregation on condition ? within time range per time granularity select attribute name , attribute name , ... group by ? having ? order by ? limit ? Example Following aggregation definition will be used for the examples. define stream TradeStream (symbol string, price double, volume long, timestamp long); define aggregation TradeAggregation from TradeStream select symbol, avg(price) as avgPrice, sum(price) as total group by symbol aggregate by timestamp every sec ... year; This query retrieves daily aggregations within the time range \"2014-02-15 00:00:00 +05:30\", \"2014-03-16 00:00:00 +05:30\" (Please note that +05:30 can be omitted if timezone is GMT) from TradeAggregation within \"2014-02-15 00:00:00 +05:30\", \"2014-03-16 00:00:00 +05:30\" per \"days\" select symbol, total, avgPrice ; This query retrieves hourly aggregations of \"FB\" symbol within the day 2014-02-15 . from TradeAggregation on symbol == \"FB\" within \"2014-02-15 **:**:** +05:30\" per \"hours\" select symbol, total, avgPrice; Insert This allows you to insert a new record to the table with the attribute values you define in the select section. Syntax select attribute name , attribute name , ... insert into table ; Example This store query inserts a new record to the table RoomOccupancyTable , with the specified attribute values. select 10 as roomNo, 2 as people insert into RoomOccupancyTable Delete The DELETE store query deletes selected records from a specified table. Syntax select ? delete table on conditional expresssion The condition element specifies the basis on which records are selected to be deleted. Note Table attributes must always be referred to with the table name as shown below: table name . attibute name . Example In this example, query deletes a record in the table named RoomTypeTable if it has value for the roomNo attribute that matches the value for the roomNumber attribute of the selection which has 10 as the actual value. select 10 as roomNumber delete RoomTypeTable on RoomTypeTable.roomNo == roomNumber; delete RoomTypeTable on RoomTypeTable.roomNo == 10; Update The UPDATE store query updates selected attributes stored in a specific table, based on a given condition. Syntax select attribute name , attribute name , ...? update table set table . attribute name = ( attribute name | expression )?, table . attribute name = ( attribute name | expression )?, ... on condition The condition element specifies the basis on which records are selected to be updated. When specifying the condition , table attributes must be referred to with the table name. You can use the set keyword to update selected attributes from the table. Here, for each assignment, the attribute specified in the left must be the table attribute, and the one specified in the right can be a stream/table attribute a mathematical operation, or other. When the set clause is not provided, all the attributes in the table are updated. Note Table attributes must always be referred to with the table name as shown below: table name . attibute name . Example The following query updates the room occupancy by increasing the value of people by 1, in the RoomOccupancyTable table for each room number greater than 10. select 10 as roomNumber, 1 as arrival update RoomTypeTable set RoomTypeTable.people = RoomTypeTable.people + arrival on RoomTypeTable.roomNo == roomNumber; update RoomTypeTable set RoomTypeTable.people = RoomTypeTable.people + 1 on RoomTypeTable.roomNo == 10; Update or Insert This allows you to update selected attributes if a record that meets the given conditions already exists in the specified table. If a matching record does not exist, the entry is inserted as a new record. Syntax select attribute name , attribute name , ... update or insert into table set table . attribute name = expression , table . attribute name = expression , ... on condition The condition element specifies the basis on which records are selected for update. When specifying the condition , table attributes should be referred to with the table name. If a record that matches the condition does not already exist in the table, the arriving event is inserted into the table. The set clause is only used when an update is performed during the insert/update operation. When set clause is used, the attribute to the left is always a table attribute, and the attribute to the right can be a stream/table attribute, mathematical operation or other. The attribute to the left (i.e., the attribute in the event table) is updated with the value of the attribute to the right if the given condition is met. When the set clause is not provided, all the attributes in the table are updated. Note Table attributes must always be referred to with the table name as shown below: table name . attibute name . Example The following query tries to update the records in the RoomAssigneeTable table that have room numbers that match the same in the selection. If such records are not found, it inserts a new record based on the values provided in the selection. select 10 as roomNo, \"single\" as type, \"abc\" as assignee update or insert into RoomAssigneeTable set RoomAssigneeTable.assignee = assignee on RoomAssigneeTable.roomNo == roomNo; Extensions Siddhi supports an extension architecture to enhance its functionality by incorporating other libraries in a seamless manner. Purpose Extensions are supported because, Siddhi core cannot have all the functionality that's needed for all the use cases, mostly use cases require different type of functionality, and for some cases there can be gaps and you need to write the functionality by yourself. All extensions have a namespace. This is used to identify the relevant extensions together, and to let you specifically call the extension. Syntax Extensions follow the following syntax; namespace : function name ( parameter , parameter , ... ) The following parameters are configured when referring a script function. Parameter Description namespace Allows Siddhi to identify the extension without conflict function name The name of the function referred. parameter The function input parameter for function execution. Extension Types Siddhi supports following extension types: Function For each event, it consumes zero or more parameters as input parameters and returns a single attribute. This can be used to manipulate existing event attributes to generate new attributes like any Function operation. This is implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.executor.function.FunctionExecutor . Example : math:sin(x) Here, the sin function of math extension returns the sin value for the x parameter. Aggregate Function For each event, it consumes zero or more parameters as input parameters and returns a single attribute with aggregated results. This can be used in conjunction with a window in order to find the aggregated results based on the given window like any Aggregate Function operation. This is implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.query.selector.attribute.aggregator.AttributeAggregatorExecutor . Example : custom:std(x) Here, the std aggregate function of custom extension returns the standard deviation of the x value based on its assigned window query. Window This allows events to be collected, generated, dropped and expired anytime without altering the event format based on the given input parameters, similar to any other Window operator. This is implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.query.processor.stream.window.WindowProcessor . Example : custom:unique(key) Here, the unique window of the custom extension retains one event for each unique key parameter. Stream Function This allows events to be generated or dropped only during event arrival and altered by adding one or more attributes to it. This is implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.query.processor.stream.function.StreamFunctionProcessor . Example : custom:pol2cart(theta,rho) Here, the pol2cart function of the custom extension returns all the events by calculating the cartesian coordinates x y and adding them as new attributes to the events. Stream Processor This allows events to be collected, generated, dropped and expired anytime by altering the event format by adding one or more attributes to it based on the given input parameters. Implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.query.processor.stream.StreamProcessor . Example : custom:perMinResults( parameter , parameter , ...) Here, the perMinResults function of the custom extension returns all events by adding one or more attributes to the events based on the conversion logic. Altered events are output every minute regardless of event arrivals. Sink Sinks provide a way to publish Siddhi events to external systems in the preferred data format. Sinks publish events from the streams via multiple transports to external endpoints in various data formats. Implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.stream.output.sink.Sink . Example : @sink(type='sink_type', static_option_key1='static_option_value1') To configure a stream to publish events via a sink, add the sink configuration to a stream definition by adding the @sink annotation with the required parameter values. The sink syntax is as above Source Source allows Siddhi to consume events from external systems , and map the events to adhere to the associated stream. Sources receive events via multiple transports and in various data formats, and direct them into streams for processing. Implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.stream.input.source.Source . Example : @source(type='source_type', static.option.key1='static_option_value1') To configure a stream that consumes events via a source, add the source configuration to a stream definition by adding the @source annotation with the required parameter values. The source syntax is as above Store You can use Store extension type to work with data/events stored in various data stores through the table abstraction . You can find more information about these extension types under the heading 'Extension types' in this document. Implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.table.record.AbstractRecordTable . Script Scripts allow you to define a function operation that is not provided in Siddhi core or its extension. It is not required to write an extension to define the function logic. Scripts allow you to write functions in other programming languages and execute them within Siddhi queries. Functions defined via scripts can be accessed in queries similar to any other inbuilt function. Implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.function.Script . Source Mapper Each @source configuration has a mapping denoted by the @map annotation that converts the incoming messages format to Siddhi events .The type parameter of the @map defines the map type to be used to map the data. The other parameters to be configured depends on the mapper selected. Some of these parameters are optional. Implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.stream.output.sink.SourceMapper . Example : @map(type='map_type', static_option_key1='static_option_value1') Sink Mapper Each @sink configuration has a mapping denoted by the @map annotation that converts the outgoing Siddhi events to configured messages format .The type parameter of the @map defines the map type to be used to map the data. The other parameters to be configured depends on the mapper selected. Some of these parameters are optional. Implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.stream.output.sink.SinkMapper . Example : @map(type='map_type', static_option_key1='static_option_value1') Example A window extension created with namespace foo and function name unique can be referred as follows: from StockExchangeStream[price = 20]#window.foo:unique(symbol) select symbol, price insert into StockQuote Available Extensions Siddhi currently has several pre written extensions that are available here We value your contribution on improving Siddhi and its extensions further. Writing Custom Extensions Custom extensions can be written in order to cater use case specific logic that are not available in Siddhi out of the box or as an existing extension. There are five types of Siddhi extensions that you can write to cater your specific use cases. These extension types and the related maven archetypes are given below. You can use these archetypes to generate Maven projects for each extension type. Follow the procedure for the required archetype, based on your project: Note When using the generated archetype please make sure you complete the @Extension annotation with proper values.

Configuring and Monitoring Siddhi Applications Threading and Asynchronous When @Async annotation is added to the Streams it enable the Streams to introduce asynchronous and multi-threading behaviour. @Async(buffer.size='256', workers='2', batch.size.max='5') define stream stream name ( attribute name attribute type , attribute name attribute type , ... ); The following elements are configured with this annotation. Annotation Description Default Value buffer.size The size of the event buffer that will be used to handover the execution to other threads. - workers Number of worker threads that will be be used to process the buffered events. 1 batch.size.max The maximum number of events that will be processed together by a worker thread at a given time. buffer.size Fault Streams When the @OnError annotation is added to a stream definition, it handles failover scenarios that occur during runtime gracefully. @OnError(action='on_error_action') define stream stream name ( attribute name attribute type , attribute name attribute type , ... ); The action parameter of the @OnError annotation defines the action to be executed during failure scenarios. The following action types can be specified via the @OnError annotation when defining a stream. If this annotation is not added, LOG is the action type by default. LOG : Logs the event with an error, and then drops the event. STREAM : A fault stream is automatically created for the base stream. The definition of the fault stream includes all the attributes of the base stream as well as an additional attribute named _error . The events are inserted into the fault stream during a failure. The error identified is captured as the value for the _error attribute. e.g., the following is a Siddhi application that includes the @OnError annotation to handle failures during runtime. @OnError(name='STREAM') define stream StreamA (symbol string, volume long); from StreamA[custom:fault() volume] insert into StreamB; from !StreamA#log(\"Error Occured\") select symbol, volume long, _error insert into tempStream; !StreamA , fault stream is automatically created when you add the @OnError annotation with the following attributes. symbol string, volume long, _error object If you include the on.error parameter in the sink configuration, failures are handled by Siddhi at the time the events are published from the Sink . @sink(type='sink_type', on.error='on.error.action') define stream stream name ( attribute name attribute type , attribute name attribute type , ... ); The action types that can be specified via the on.error parameter when configuring a sink are as follows. If this parameter is not included in the sink configuration, LOG is the action type by default. LOG : Logs the event with the error, and then drops the event. WAIT : The thread waits in the back-off and re-trying state, and reconnects once the connection is re-established. STREAM : Corresponding fault stream is populated with the failed event and the error while publishing. Statistics Use @app:statistics app level annotation to evaluate the performance of an application, you can enable the statistics of a Siddhi application to be published. This is done via the @app:statistics annotation that can be added to a Siddhi application as shown in the following example. @app:statistics(reporter = 'console') The following elements are configured with this annotation. Annotation Description Default Value reporter The interface in which statistics for the Siddhi application are published. Possible values are as follows: console jmx console interval The time interval (in seconds) at which the statistics for the Siddhi application are reported. 60 include If this parameter is added, only the types of metrics you specify are included in the reporting. The required metric types can be specified as a comma-separated list. It is also possible to use wild cards All ( . ) The metrics are reported in the following format. io.siddhi.SiddhiApps. SiddhiAppName .Siddhi. Component Type . Component Name . Metrics name The following table lists the types of metrics supported for different Siddhi application component types.

The following diagram depicts how event flows work with some of the key Siddhi Streaming SQL elements The following diagram depicts how event flows work with some of the key Siddhi Streaming SQL elements of the Siddhi Application. Below table provides brief description of a few key elements in the Siddhi Streaming SQL Language. Elements Description Stream A logical series of events ordered in time with a uniquely identifiable name, and set of defined attributes with specific data types defining its schema. Event An event is associated with only one stream, and all events of that stream have an identical set of attributes that are assigned specific types (or the same schema). An event contains a timestamp and set of attribute values according to the schema. Table A structured representation of data stored with a defined schema. Stored data can be backed by In-Memory , RDBMs , MongoDB , etc. to be accessed and manipulated at runtime. Query A logical construct that processes events in streaming manner by combining existing streams and/or tables, and generates events to an output stream or table. A query consumes one or more input streams, and zero or one table. Then it processes these events in a streaming manner and publishes the output events to streams or tables for further processing or to generate notifications. Source A contract that consumes data from external sources (such as TCP , Kafka , HTTP , etc)in the form of events, then converts each event (which can be in XML , JSON , binary , etc. format) to a Siddhi event, and passes that to a Stream for processing. Sink A contract that takes events arriving at a stream, maps them to a predefined data format (such as XML , JSON , binary , etc), and publishes them to external endpoints (such as E-mail , TCP , Kafka , HTTP , etc). Input Handler A mechanism to programmatically inject events into streams. Stream/Query Callback A mechanism to programmatically consume output events from streams and queries. Partition A logical container that isolates the processing of queries based on partition keys. Here, a separate instance of queries is generated for each partition key to achieve isolation. Inner Stream A positionable stream that connects portioned queries within their partitions, preserving isolation. Grammar An element of Siddhi SQL can be composed together as a script in a Siddhi application, Here each construct must be separated by a semicolon ( ; ) as shown in the below syntax. siddhi app : app annotation * ( stream definition | table definition | ... ) + ( query | partition ) + ; Example Siddhi Application named Temperature-Analytics defined with a stream named TempStream and a query named 5minAvgQuery for processing it. @app:name('Temperature-Analytics') define stream TempStream (deviceID long, roomNo int, temp double); @name('5minAvgQuery') from TempStream#window.time(5 min) select roomNo, avg(temp) as avgTemp group by roomNo insert into OutputStream;","title":"Siddhi Application"},{"location":"query-guide/#stream","text":"A stream is a logical series of events ordered in time. Its schema is defined via the stream definition . A stream definition contains a unique name and a set of attributes with specific types and uniquely identifiable names within the stream. All the events that are selected to be received into a specific stream have the same schema (i.e., have the same attributes in the same order). Purpose By defining a schema it unifies common types of events together. This enables them to be processed via queries using their defined attributes in a streaming manner, and allow sinks and sources to map events to/from various data formats. Syntax The syntax for defining a new stream is as follows. define stream stream name ( attribute name attribute type , attribute name attribute type , ... ); The following parameters are configured in a stream definition. Parameter Description stream name The name of the stream created. (It is recommended to define a stream name in PascalCase .) attribute name The schema of an stream is defined by its attributes with uniquely identifiable attribute names. (It is recommended to define attribute names in camelCase .) attribute type The type of each attribute defined in the schema. This can be STRING , INT , LONG , DOUBLE , FLOAT , BOOL or OBJECT . To use and refer stream and attribute names that do not follow [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9]* format enclose them in `. E.g. ``` $test(0)` ```. To make the stream process events in asynchronous and multi-threading manner use the @Async annotation as shown in Threading and Asynchronous configuration section.

A source configuration allows you to define a mapping in order to convert each incoming event from its native data format to a Siddhi event. When customizations to such mappings are not provided, Siddhi assumes that the arriving event adheres to the predefined format based on the stream definition and the selected message format. Purpose Source allows Siddhi to consume events from external systems, and map the events to adhere to the associated stream. Syntax To configure a stream that consumes events via a source, add the source configuration to a stream definition by adding the @source annotation with the required parameter values. The source syntax is as follows: @source(type='source_type', static.option.key1='static_option_value1', static.option.keyN='static_option_valueN', @map(type='map_type', static.option_key1='static_option_value1', static.option.keyN='static_option_valueN', @attributes( attributeN='attribute_mapping_N', attribute1='attribute_mapping_1') ) ) define stream StreamName (attribute1 Type1, attributeN TypeN); This syntax includes the following annotations.

Map Attributes @attributes is an optional annotation used with @map to define custom mapping. When @attributes is not provided, each mapper assumes that the incoming events adhere to its own default data format. By adding the @attributes annotation, you can configure mappers to extract data from the incoming message selectively, and assign them to attributes. There are two ways you can configure map attributes.

This can be done by using asterisk ( * ) or by omitting the `select` statement. E.g., Both the following queries select all the attributes in the `NewTempStream` stream. from TempStream select * insert into NewTempStream; or from TempStream insert into NewTempStream; Renaming attributes This selects attributes from the input streams and inserts them into the output stream with different names. E.g., This query renames `roomNo` to `roomNumber` and `temp` to `temperature`. from TempStream select roomNo as roomNumber, temp as temperature insert into RoomTempStream; Introducing the constant value This adds constant values by assigning it to an attribute using `as`. E.g., This query specifies 'C' to be used as the constant value for `scale` attribute. from TempStream select roomNo, temp, 'C' as scale insert into RoomTempStream; Using mathematical and logical expressions This uses attributes with mathematical and logical expressions in the precedence order given below, and assigns them to the output attribute using `as`.

Purpose Streams are stateless. Therefore, in order to join two streams, they need to be connected to a window so that there is a pool of events that can be used for joining. Joins also accept conditions to join the appropriate events from each stream. During the joining process each incoming event of each stream is matched against all the events in the other stream's window based on the given condition, and the output events are generated for all the matching event pairs. Note Join can also be performed with stored data , aggregation or externally defined windows . Syntax The syntax for a join is as follows: from input stream #window. window name ( parameter , ... ) {unidirectional} {as reference } join input stream #window. window name ( parameter , ... ) {unidirectional} {as reference } on join condition select attribute name , attribute name , ... insert into output stream Here, the join condition allows you to match the attributes from both the streams. Unidirectional join operation By default, events arriving at either stream can trigger the joining process. However, if you want to control the join execution, you can add the unidirectional keyword next to a stream in the join definition as depicted in the syntax in order to enable that stream to trigger the join operation. Here, events arriving at other stream only update the window of that stream, and this stream does not trigger the join operation. Note The unidirectional keyword cannot be applied to both the input streams because the default behaviour already allows both streams to trigger the join operation. Example Assuming that the temperature of regulators are updated every minute. Following is a Siddhi App that controls the temperature regulators if they are not already on for all the rooms with a room temperature greater than 30 degrees. define stream TempStream(deviceID long, roomNo int, temp double); define stream RegulatorStream(deviceID long, roomNo int, isOn bool); from TempStream[temp 30.0]#window.time(1 min) as T join RegulatorStream[isOn == false]#window.length(1) as R on T.roomNo == R.roomNo select T.roomNo, R.deviceID, 'start' as action insert into RegulatorActionStream; Supported join types Following are the supported operations of a join clause. Inner join (join) This is the default behaviour of a join operation. join is used as the keyword to join both the streams. The output is generated only if there is a matching event in both the streams. Left outer join The left outer join operation allows you to join two streams to be merged based on a condition. left outer join is used as the keyword to join both the streams. Here, it returns all the events of left stream even if there are no matching events in the right stream by having null values for the attributes of the right stream. Example The following query generates output events for all events from the StockStream stream regardless of whether a matching symbol exists in the TwitterStream stream or not. from StockStream#window.time(1 min) as S left outer join TwitterStream#window.length(1) as T on S.symbol== T.symbol select S.symbol as symbol, T.tweet, S.price insert into outputStream ; Right outer join This is similar to a left outer join. Right outer join is used as the keyword to join both the streams. It returns all the events of the right stream even if there are no matching events in the left stream. Full outer join The full outer join combines the results of left outer join and right outer join. full outer join is used as the keyword to join both the streams.

A partition can contain one or more queries and there can be multiple instances where the same queries and streams are replicated for each partition. Each partition is tagged with a partition key. Those partitions only process the events that match the corresponding partition key. Purpose Partitions allow you to process the events groups in isolation so that event processing can be performed using the same set of queries for each group. Partition key generation A partition key can be generated in the following two methods: Partition by value This is created by generating unique values using input stream attributes. Syntax partition with ( expression of stream name , expression of stream name , ... ) begin query query ... end; Example This query calculates the maximum temperature recorded within the last 10 events per deviceID . partition with ( deviceID of TempStream ) begin from TempStream#window.length(10) select roomNo, deviceID, max(temp) as maxTemp insert into DeviceTempStream; end; Partition by range This is created by mapping each partition key to a range condition of the input streams numerical attribute.

Its schema is defined via the table definition that is similar to a stream definition. These events are by default stored in-memory , but Siddhi also provides store extensions to work with data/events stored in various data stores through the table abstraction. Purpose Tables allow Siddhi to work with stored events. By defining a schema for tables Siddhi enables them to be processed by queries using their defined attributes with the streaming data. You can also interactively query the state of the stored events in the table. Syntax The syntax for a new table definition is as follows: define table table name ( attribute name attribute type , attribute name attribute type , ... ); The following parameters are configured in a table definition: Parameter Description table name The name of the table defined. ( PascalCase is used for table name as a convention.) attribute name The schema of the table is defined by its attributes with uniquely identifiable attribute names ( camelCase is used for attribute names as a convention.) attribute type The type of each attribute defined in the schema. This can be STRING , INT , LONG , DOUBLE , FLOAT , BOOL or OBJECT . Example The following defines a table named RoomTypeTable with roomNo and type attributes of data types int and string respectively. define table RoomTypeTable ( roomNo int, type string ); Primary Keys Tables can be configured with primary keys to avoid the duplication of data. Primary keys are configured by including the @PrimaryKey( 'key1', 'key2' ) annotation to the table definition. Each event table configuration can have only one @PrimaryKey annotation. The number of attributes supported differ based on the table implementations. When more than one attribute is used for the primary key, the uniqueness of the events stored in the table is determined based on the combination of values for those attributes. Examples This query creates an event table with the symbol attribute as the primary key. Therefore each entry in this table must have a unique value for symbol attribute. @PrimaryKey('symbol') define table StockTable (symbol string, price float, volume long); Indexes Indexes allow tables to be searched/modified much faster. Indexes are configured by including the @Index( 'key1', 'key2' ) annotation to the table definition. Each event table configuration can have 0-1 @Index annotations. Support for the @Index annotation and the number of attributes supported differ based on the table implementations. When more then one attribute is used for index, each one of them is used to index the table for fast access of the data. Indexes can be configured together with primary keys.

When carrying out data purging, the retention period you have specified for each granularity in the incremental aggregation query is taken into account.

That is, it allows you to obtain aggregates such as sum , count , avg , min , max , count and distinctCount of stream attributes for durations such as sec , min , hour , etc. This is of considerable importance in many Analytics scenarios because aggregate values are often needed for several time periods. Furthermore, this ensures that the aggregations are not lost due to unexpected system failures because aggregates can be stored in different persistence stores .

This identifies the number of expired events to retain in a buffer in order to handle out of order event processing. This is an optional parameter that is applicable only if aggregation is based on external timestamps (because events aggregated based on event arrival time cannot be out of order). Siddhi determines whether an event is expired or not based on the timestamp of the latest event and the most granular duration for which aggregation is calculated. e.g., If the aggregation is calculated for sec\u2026year , the most granular duration is seconds. Therefore, if the buffer size is 3 and events arrive during 51 st , 52 nd , 53 rd and 54 th seconds, all of the older aggregations (i.e., for 51 st , 52 nd and 53 rd seconds) are kept in the buffer because the latest event arrived during the 54 th second.

Parameter Description function name The name of the function ( camelCase is used for the function name) as a convention. language name The name of the programming language used to define the script, such as javascript , r and scala . return type The attribute type of the function\u2019s return. This can be int , long , float , double , string , bool or object . Here the function implementer should be responsible for returning the output attribute on the defined return type for proper functionality. operation of the function Here, the execution logic of the function is added. This logic should be written in the language specified under the language name , and it should return the output in the data type specified via the return type parameter. Examples This query performs concatenation using JavaScript, and returns the output as a string. define function concatFn[javascript] return string { var str1 = data[0]; var str2 = data[1]; var str3 = data[2]; var responce = str1 + str2 + str3; return responce; }; define stream TempStream(deviceID long, roomNo int, temp double); from TempStream select concatFn(roomNo,'-',deviceID) as id, temp insert into DeviceTempStream;","title":"Script"},{"location":"query-guide/#store-query","text":"Siddhi store queries are a set of on-demand queries that can be used to perform operations on Siddhi tables, windows, and aggregators.

Purpose Extensions are supported because, Siddhi core cannot have all the functionality that's needed for all the use cases, mostly use cases require different type of functionality, and for some cases there can be gaps and you need to write the functionality by yourself. All extensions have a namespace. This is used to identify the relevant extensions together, and to let you specifically call the extension. Syntax Extensions follow the following syntax; namespace : function name ( parameter , parameter , ... ) The following parameters are configured when referring a script function. Parameter Description namespace Allows Siddhi to identify the extension without conflict function name The name of the function referred. parameter The function input parameter for function execution. Extension Types Siddhi supports following extension types: Function For each event, it consumes zero or more parameters as input parameters and returns a single attribute. This can be used to manipulate existing event attributes to generate new attributes like any Function operation. This is implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.executor.function.FunctionExecutor . Example : math:sin(x) Here, the sin function of math extension returns the sin value for the x parameter. Aggregate Function For each event, it consumes zero or more parameters as input parameters and returns a single attribute with aggregated results. This can be used in conjunction with a window in order to find the aggregated results based on the given window like any Aggregate Function operation. This is implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.query.selector.attribute.aggregator.AttributeAggregatorExecutor . Example : custom:std(x) Here, the std aggregate function of custom extension returns the standard deviation of the x value based on its assigned window query. Window This allows events to be collected, generated, dropped and expired anytime without altering the event format based on the given input parameters, similar to any other Window operator. This is implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.query.processor.stream.window.WindowProcessor . Example : custom:unique(key) Here, the unique window of the custom extension retains one event for each unique key parameter. Stream Function This allows events to be generated or dropped only during event arrival and altered by adding one or more attributes to it. This is implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.query.processor.stream.function.StreamFunctionProcessor . Example : custom:pol2cart(theta,rho) Here, the pol2cart function of the custom extension returns all the events by calculating the cartesian coordinates x y and adding them as new attributes to the events. Stream Processor This allows events to be collected, generated, dropped and expired anytime by altering the event format by adding one or more attributes to it based on the given input parameters. Implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.query.processor.stream.StreamProcessor . Example : custom:perMinResults( parameter , parameter , ...) Here, the perMinResults function of the custom extension returns all events by adding one or more attributes to the events based on the conversion logic. Altered events are output every minute regardless of event arrivals. Sink Sinks provide a way to publish Siddhi events to external systems in the preferred data format. Sinks publish events from the streams via multiple transports to external endpoints in various data formats. Implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.stream.output.sink.Sink . Example : @sink(type='sink_type', static_option_key1='static_option_value1') To configure a stream to publish events via a sink, add the sink configuration to a stream definition by adding the @sink annotation with the required parameter values. The sink syntax is as above Source Source allows Siddhi to consume events from external systems , and map the events to adhere to the associated stream. Sources receive events via multiple transports and in various data formats, and direct them into streams for processing. Implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.stream.input.source.Source . Example : @source(type='source_type', static.option.key1='static_option_value1') To configure a stream that consumes events via a source, add the source configuration to a stream definition by adding the @source annotation with the required parameter values. The source syntax is as above Store You can use Store extension type to work with data/events stored in various data stores through the table abstraction . You can find more information about these extension types under the heading 'Extension types' in this document. Implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.table.record.AbstractRecordTable . Script Scripts allow you to define a function operation that is not provided in Siddhi core or its extension. It is not required to write an extension to define the function logic. Scripts allow you to write functions in other programming languages and execute them within Siddhi queries. Functions defined via scripts can be accessed in queries similar to any other inbuilt function. Implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.function.Script . Source Mapper Each @source configuration has a mapping denoted by the @map annotation that converts the incoming messages format to Siddhi events .The type parameter of the @map defines the map type to be used to map the data. The other parameters to be configured depends on the mapper selected. Some of these parameters are optional. Implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.stream.output.sink.SourceMapper . Example : @map(type='map_type', static_option_key1='static_option_value1') Sink Mapper Each @sink configuration has a mapping denoted by the @map annotation that converts the outgoing Siddhi events to configured messages format .The type parameter of the @map defines the map type to be used to map the data. The other parameters to be configured depends on the mapper selected. Some of these parameters are optional. Implemented by extending io.siddhi.core.stream.output.sink.SinkMapper . Example : @map(type='map_type', static_option_key1='static_option_value1') Example A window extension created with namespace foo and function name unique can be referred as follows: from StockExchangeStream[price = 20]#window.foo:unique(symbol) select symbol, price insert into StockQuote Available Extensions Siddhi currently has several pre written extensions that are available here We value your contribution on improving Siddhi and its extensions further.","title":"Extensions"},{"location":"query-guide/#writing-custom-extensions","text":"Custom extensions can be written in order to cater use case specific logic that are not available in Siddhi out of the box or as an existing extension.

Using Siddhi in WSO2 Stream Processor As a Java Library As a Python Library Using Siddhi in WSO2 Stream Processor You can use Siddhi in the latest WSO2 Stream Processor . It is equipped with a graphical and source query editor, debugger, event simulator, monitoring, data visualization and reporting support. All none GPL Siddhi extensions are shipped by default with WSO2 Stream Processor, and you can add other Siddhi extensions or upgrade existing Siddhi extensions, by removing and adding relevant Siddhi extension and its dependent OSGi bundles to SP_HOME /lib directory. If the Siddhi Extension depends on non OSGi jars convert them to OSGi bundles by following the steps provided in the SP docs . Refer the WSO2 SP Quick Start Guide to try out Siddhi within WSO2 Stream Processor. Refer WSO2 Stream Processor Documentation for more information. Using Siddhi as a Java library To embed Siddhi as a java library into your project and to get a working sample, follow the bellow steps: Step 1: Creating a Java Project Create a Java project using Maven and include the following dependencies in its pom.xml file. dependency groupId org.wso2.siddhi /groupId artifactId siddhi-core /artifactId version 4.x.x /version /dependency dependency groupId org.wso2.siddhi /groupId artifactId siddhi-query-api /artifactId version 4.x.x /version /dependency dependency groupId org.wso2.siddhi /groupId artifactId siddhi-query-compiler /artifactId version 4.x.x /version /dependency dependency groupId org.wso2.siddhi /groupId artifactId siddhi-annotations /artifactId version 4.x.x /version /dependency Note : You can create the Java project using any method you prefer. The required dependencies can be downloaded from here . Create a new Java class in the Maven project. Step 2: Creating Siddhi Application A Siddhi application is a self contained execution entity that defines how data is captured, processed and sent out. Create a Siddhi Application by defining a stream definition E.g. StockEventStream defining the format of the incoming events, and by defining a Siddhi query as follows. String siddhiApp = \"define stream StockEventStream (symbol string, price float, volume long); \" + \" \" + \"@info(name = 'query1') \" + \"from StockEventStream#window.time(5 sec) \" + \"select symbol, sum(price) as price, sum(volume) as volume \" + \"group by symbol \" + \"insert into AggregateStockStream ;\"; This Siddhi query groups the events by symbol and calculates aggregates such as the sum for price and sum of volume for the last 5 seconds time window. Then it inserts the results into a stream named AggregateStockStream . Step 3: Creating Siddhi Application Runtime This step involves creating a runtime representation of a Siddhi application. SiddhiManager siddhiManager = new SiddhiManager(); SiddhiAppRuntime siddhiAppRuntime = siddhiManager.createSiddhiAppRuntime(siddhiApp); The Siddhi Manager parses the Siddhi application and provides you with an Siddhi application runtime. This Siddhi application runtime can be used to add callbacks and input handlers such that you can programmatically invoke the Siddhi application. Step 4: Registering a Callback You can register a callback to the Siddhi application runtime in order to receive the results once the events are processed. There are two types of callbacks: Query callback : This subscribes to a query. Stream callback : This subscribes to an event stream. In this example, a Stream callback is added to the AggregateStockStream to capture the processed events. siddhiAppRuntime.addCallback(\"AggregateStockStream\", new StreamCallback() { @Override public void receive(Event[] events) { EventPrinter.print(events); } }); Here, once the results are generated they are sent to the receive method of this callback. An event printer is added inside this callback to print the incoming events for demonstration purposes. Step 5: Sending Events In order to programmatically send events from the stream you need to obtain it's an input handler as follows: InputHandler inputHandler = siddhiAppRuntime.getInputHandler(\"StockEventStream\"); Use the following code to start the Siddhi application runtime, send events and to shutdown Siddhi: //Start SiddhiApp runtime siddhiAppRuntime.start(); //Sending events to Siddhi inputHandler.send(new Object[]{\"IBM\", 100f, 100L}); Thread.sleep(1000); inputHandler.send(new Object[]{\"IBM\", 200f, 300L}); inputHandler.send(new Object[]{\"WSO2\", 60f, 200L}); Thread.sleep(1000); inputHandler.send(new Object[]{\"WSO2\", 70f, 400L}); inputHandler.send(new Object[]{\"GOOG\", 50f, 30L}); Thread.sleep(1000); inputHandler.send(new Object[]{\"IBM\", 200f, 400L}); Thread.sleep(2000); inputHandler.send(new Object[]{\"WSO2\", 70f, 50L}); Thread.sleep(2000); inputHandler.send(new Object[]{\"WSO2\", 80f, 400L}); inputHandler.send(new Object[]{\"GOOG\", 60f, 30L}); Thread.sleep(1000); //Shutdown SiddhiApp runtime siddhiAppRuntime.shutdown(); //Shutdown Siddhi siddhiManager.shutdown(); When the events are sent, you can see the output logged by the event printer. Find the executable Java code of this example here For more code examples, see quick start samples for Siddhi . Using Siddhi as a Python library To use Siddhi in Python and to get a working sample follow the bellow sample: Step 1: Initialize libraries and imports Add log4j.xml file to working directory in order to enable log4j logging. Log4j is used by PrintEvent to generate output. Create a .py file add add the following Siddhi related imports: from PySiddhi4.DataTypes.LongType import LongType from PySiddhi4.core.SiddhiManager import SiddhiManager from PySiddhi4.core.query.output.callback.QueryCallback import QueryCallback from PySiddhi4.core.util.EventPrinter import PrintEvent from time import sleep Step 2: Creating Siddhi Application A Siddhi application is a self contained execution entity that defines how data is captured, processed and sent out. Create a Siddhi Application by defining a stream definition E.g. StockEventStream defining the format of the incoming events, and by defining a Siddhi query as follows. siddhiManager = SiddhiManager() # Siddhi Query to filter events with volume less than 150 as output siddhiApp = \"define stream StockEventStream (symbol string, price float, volume long); \" + \\ \"@info(name = 'query1') from StockEventStream[volume 150] select symbol,price insert into OutputStream;\" This Siddhi query query to detect stock records having volume less than 150, and then inserts the results into a stream named OutputStream . For more details on Siddhi Query Language, refer Siddhi Query Language Guide . Step 3: Creating Siddhi Application Runtime This step involves creating a runtime representation of a Siddhi application. # Generate runtime siddhiAppRuntime = siddhiManager.createSiddhiAppRuntime(siddhiApp) Step 4: Registering a Callback You can register a callback to the Siddhi application runtime in order to receive the results once the events are processed. There are two types of callbacks: Query callback : This subscribes to a query. Stream callback : This subscribes to an event stream. In this example, a Query callback is added to the query1 to capture the processed events. # Add listener to capture output events class QueryCallbackImpl(QueryCallback): def receive(self, timestamp, inEvents, outEvents): PrintEvent(timestamp, inEvents, outEvents) siddhiAppRuntime.addCallback(\"query1\",QueryCallbackImpl()) Here, once the results are generated they are sent to the receive method of this callback. An event printer is added inside this callback to print the incoming events for demonstration purposes. Step 5: Sending Events In order to programmatically send events from the stream you need to obtain it's an input handler as follows: # Retrieving input handler to push events into Siddhi inputHandler = siddhiAppRuntime.getInputHandler(\"StockEventStream\") Use the following code to start the Siddhi application runtime, send events and to shutdown Siddhi: # Starting event processing siddhiAppRuntime.start() # Sending events to Siddhi inputHandler.send([\"IBM\",700.0,LongType(100)]) inputHandler.send([\"WSO2\", 60.5, LongType(200)]) inputHandler.send([\"GOOG\", 50, LongType(30)]) inputHandler.send([\"IBM\", 76.6, LongType(400)]) inputHandler.send([\"WSO2\", 45.6, LongType(50)]) # Wait for response sleep(10) #Shutdown SiddhiApp runtime siddhiAppRuntime.stop() # Shutdown Siddhi siddhiManager.shutdown() Full sample code This sample demonstrating how to write a streaming query to detect stock records having volume less than 150. from PySiddhi4.DataTypes.LongType import LongType from PySiddhi4.core.SiddhiManager import SiddhiManager from PySiddhi4.core.query.output.callback.QueryCallback import QueryCallback from PySiddhi4.core.util.EventPrinter import PrintEvent from time import sleep siddhiManager = SiddhiManager() # Siddhi Query to filter events with volume less than 150 as output siddhiApp = \"define stream StockEventStream (symbol string, price float, volume long); \" + \\ \"@info(name = 'query1') from StockEventStream[volume 150] select symbol,price insert into OutputStream;\" # Generate runtime siddhiAppRuntime = siddhiManager.createSiddhiAppRuntime(siddhiApp) # Add listener to capture output events class QueryCallbackImpl(QueryCallback): def receive(self, timestamp, inEvents, outEvents): PrintEvent(timestamp, inEvents, outEvents) siddhiAppRuntime.addCallback(\"query1\",QueryCallbackImpl()) # Retrieving input handler to push events into Siddhi inputHandler = siddhiAppRuntime.getInputHandler(\"StockEventStream\") # Starting event processing siddhiAppRuntime.start() # Sending events to Siddhi inputHandler.send([\"IBM\",700.0,LongType(100)]) inputHandler.send([\"WSO2\", 60.5, LongType(200)]) inputHandler.send([\"GOOG\", 50, LongType(30)]) inputHandler.send([\"IBM\", 76.6, LongType(400)]) inputHandler.send([\"WSO2\", 45.6, LongType(50)]) # Wait for response sleep(10) siddhiAppRuntime.stop() siddhiManager.shutdown() Expected Output The 3 events with volume less than 150 are printed in log.

The events that belong to a specific session are identified by a grouping attribute (i.e., a session key). A session gap period is specified to determine the time period after which the session is considered to be expired. A new event that arrives with a specific value for the session key is matched with the session window with the same session key. When performing aggregations for a specific session, you can include events with the matching session key that arrive after the session is expired if required. This is done by specifying a latency time period that is less than the session gap period. To have aggregate functions with session windows, the events need to be grouped by the session key via a 'group by' clause.

This is specified in seconds, minutes, or milliseconds (i.e., 'min', 'sec', or 'ms'. INT LONG TIME No No window.key The grouping attribute for events. default-key STRING Yes No window.allowedlatency This specifies the time period for which the session window is valid after the expiration of the session. The time period specified here should be less than the session time gap (which is specified via the 'window.session' parameter). 0 INT LONG TIME Yes No Examples EXAMPLE 1 define stream PurchaseEventStream (user string, item_number int, price float, quantity int); @info(name='query0) from PurchaseEventStream#window.session(5 sec, user, 2 sec) select * insert all events into OutputStream; This query processes events that arrive at the PurchaseEvent input stream. The 'user' attribute is the session key, and the session gap is 5 seconds. '2 sec' is specified as the allowed latency. Therefore, events with the matching user name that arrive 2 seconds after the expiration of the session are also considered when performing aggregations for the session identified by the given user name. sort (Window) This window holds a batch of events that equal the number specified as the windowLength and sorts them in the given order. Syntax sort( INT window.length, STRING attribute, STRING order) QUERY PARAMETERS Name Description Default Value Possible Data Types Optional Dynamic window.length The size of the window length.

The events that belong to a specific session are identified by a grouping attribute (i.e., a session key). A session gap period is specified to determine the time period after which the session is considered to be expired. A new event that arrives with a specific value for the session key is matched with the session window with the same session key. When performing aggregations for a specific session, you can include events with the matching session key that arrive after the session is expired if required. This is done by specifying a latency time period that is less than the session gap period. To have aggregate functions with session windows, the events need to be grouped by the session key via a 'group by' clause.

The 'user' attribute is the session key, and the session gap is 5 seconds. '2 sec' is specified as the allowed latency. Therefore, events with the matching user name that arrive 2 seconds after the expiration of the session are also considered when performing aggregations for the session identified by the given user name. sort (Window) This window holds a batch of events that equal the number specified as the windowLength and sorts them in the given order.

STRING Yes No Examples EXAMPLE 1 define stream purchase (cardNo string, price float); define window purchaseWindow (cardNo string, price float) lossyFrequent(0.1, 0.01); @info(name = 'query0') from purchase[price = 30] insert into purchaseWindow; @info(name = 'query1') from purchaseWindow select cardNo, price insert all events into PotentialFraud; lossyFrequent(0.1, 0.01) returns all the events of which the current frequency exceeds 0.1, with an error bound of 0.01. EXAMPLE 2 define stream purchase (cardNo string, price float); define window purchaseWindow (cardNo string, price float) lossyFrequent(0.3, 0.05, cardNo); @info(name = 'query0') from purchase[price = 30] insert into purchaseWindow; @info(name = 'query1') from purchaseWindow select cardNo, price insert all events into PotentialFraud; lossyFrequent(0.3, 0.05, cardNo) returns all the events of which the cardNo attributes frequency exceeds 0.3, with an error bound of 0.05. session (Window) This is a session window that holds events that belong to a specific session. The events that belong to a specific session are identified by a grouping attribute (i.e., a session key). A session gap period is specified to determine the time period after which the session is considered to be expired. A new event that arrives with a specific value for the session key is matched with the session window with the same session key. When performing aggregations for a specific session, you can include events with the matching session key that arrive after the session is expired if required. This is done by specifying a latency time period that is less than the session gap period. To have aggregate functions with session windows, the events need to be grouped by the session key via a 'group by' clause. Syntax session( INT|LONG|TIME window.session, STRING window.key, INT|LONG|TIME window.allowedlatency) QUERY PARAMETERS Name Description Default Value Possible Data Types Optional Dynamic window.session The time period for which the session considered is valid. This is specified in seconds, minutes, or milliseconds (i.e., 'min', 'sec', or 'ms'. INT LONG TIME No No window.key The grouping attribute for events. default-key STRING Yes No window.allowedlatency This specifies the time period for which the session window is valid after the expiration of the session. The time period specified here should be less than the session time gap (which is specified via the 'window.session' parameter). 0 INT LONG TIME Yes No Examples EXAMPLE 1 define stream PurchaseEventStream (user string, item_number int, price float, quantity int); @info(name='query0) from PurchaseEventStream#window.session(5 sec, user, 2 sec) select * insert all events into OutputStream; This query processes events that arrive at the PurchaseEvent input stream. The 'user' attribute is the session key, and the session gap is 5 seconds. '2 sec' is specified as the allowed latency. Therefore, events with the matching user name that arrive 2 seconds after the expiration of the session are also considered when performing aggregations for the session identified by the given user name. sort (Window) This window holds a batch of events that equal the number specified as the windowLength and sorts them in the given order. Syntax sort( INT window.length, STRING attribute, STRING order) QUERY PARAMETERS Name Description Default Value Possible Data Types Optional Dynamic window.length The size of the window length. INT No No attribute The attribute that should be checked for the order. The concatenation of all the attributes of the event is considered. STRING Yes No order The order define as \"asc\" or \"desc\". asc STRING Yes No Examples EXAMPLE 1 define stream cseEventStream (symbol string, price float, volume long); define window cseEventWindow (symbol string, price float, volume long) sort(2,volume, 'asc'); @info(name = 'query0') from cseEventStream insert into cseEventWindow; @info(name = 'query1') from cseEventWindow select volume insert all events into outputStream ; sort(5, price, 'asc') keeps the events sorted by price in the ascending order. Therefore, at any given time, the window contains the 5 lowest prices. time (Window) A sliding time window that holds events that arrived during the last windowTime period at a given time, and gets updated for each event arrival and expiry. Syntax time( INT|LONG|TIME window.time) QUERY PARAMETERS Name Description Default Value Possible Data Types Optional Dynamic window.time The sliding time period for which the window should hold events.

Syntax timeBatch( INT|LONG|TIME window.time, INT start.time) QUERY PARAMETERS Name Description Default Value Possible Data Types Optional Dynamic window.time The batch time period for which the window should hold events. INT LONG TIME No No start.time This specifies an offset in milliseconds in order to start the window at a time different to the standard time. Timestamp of first event INT Yes No Examples EXAMPLE 1 define window cseEventWindow (symbol string, price float, volume int) timeBatch(20 sec) output all events; @info(name = 'query0') from cseEventStream insert into cseEventWindow; @info(name = 'query1') from cseEventWindow select symbol, sum(price) as price insert all events into outputStream ; This will processing events arrived every 20 seconds as a batch and out put all events. timeLength (Window) A sliding time window that, at a given time holds the last window.length events that arrived during last window.time period, and gets updated for every event arrival and expiry. Syntax timeLength( INT|LONG|TIME window.time, INT window.length) QUERY PARAMETERS Name Description Default Value Possible Data Types Optional Dynamic window.time The sliding time period for which the window should hold events.

The events that belong to a specific session are identified by a grouping attribute (i.e., a session key). A session gap period is specified to determine the time period after which the session is considered to be expired. A new event that arrives with a specific value for the session key is matched with the session window with the same session key. When performing aggregations for a specific session, you can include events with the matching session key that arrive after the session is expired if required. This is done by specifying a latency time period that is less than the session gap period. To have aggregate functions with session windows, the events need to be grouped by the session key via a 'group by' clause.

The 'user' attribute is the session key, and the session gap is 5 seconds. '2 sec' is specified as the allowed latency. Therefore, events with the matching user name that arrive 2 seconds after the expiration of the session are also considered when performing aggregations for the session identified by the given user name. sort (Window) This window holds a batch of events that equal the number specified as the windowLength and sorts them in the given order.

Syntax lossyFrequent( DOUBLE support.threshold, DOUBLE error.bound, STRING attribute) QUERY PARAMETERS Name Description Default Value Possible Data Types Optional Dynamic support.threshold The support threshold value. DOUBLE No No error.bound The error bound value. DOUBLE No No attribute The attributes to group the events. If no attributes are given, the concatenation of all the attributes of the event is considered. The concatenation of all the attributes of the event is considered. STRING Yes No Examples EXAMPLE 1 define stream purchase (cardNo string, price float); define window purchaseWindow (cardNo string, price float) lossyFrequent(0.1, 0.01); @info(name = 'query0') from purchase[price = 30] insert into purchaseWindow; @info(name = 'query1') from purchaseWindow select cardNo, price insert all events into PotentialFraud; lossyFrequent(0.1, 0.01) returns all the events of which the current frequency exceeds 0.1, with an error bound of 0.01. EXAMPLE 2 define stream purchase (cardNo string, price float); define window purchaseWindow (cardNo string, price float) lossyFrequent(0.3, 0.05, cardNo); @info(name = 'query0') from purchase[price = 30] insert into purchaseWindow; @info(name = 'query1') from purchaseWindow select cardNo, price insert all events into PotentialFraud; lossyFrequent(0.3, 0.05, cardNo) returns all the events of which the cardNo attributes frequency exceeds 0.3, with an error bound of 0.05. session (Window) This is a session window that holds events that belong to a specific session. The events that belong to a specific session are identified by a grouping attribute (i.e., a session key). A session gap period is specified to determine the time period after which the session is considered to be expired. A new event that arrives with a specific value for the session key is matched with the session window with the same session key. When performing aggregations for a specific session, you can include events with the matching session key that arrive after the session is expired if required. This is done by specifying a latency time period that is less than the session gap period. To have aggregate functions with session windows, the events need to be grouped by the session key via a 'group by' clause. Syntax session( INT|LONG|TIME window.session, STRING window.key, INT|LONG|TIME window.allowedlatency) QUERY PARAMETERS Name Description Default Value Possible Data Types Optional Dynamic window.session The time period for which the session considered is valid. This is specified in seconds, minutes, or milliseconds (i.e., 'min', 'sec', or 'ms'.

The time period specified here should be less than the session time gap (which is specified via the 'window.session' parameter). 0 INT LONG TIME Yes No Examples EXAMPLE 1 define stream PurchaseEventStream (user string, item_number int, price float, quantity int); @info(name='query0) from PurchaseEventStream#window.session(5 sec, user, 2 sec) select * insert all events into OutputStream; This query processes events that arrive at the PurchaseEvent input stream. The 'user' attribute is the session key, and the session gap is 5 seconds. '2 sec' is specified as the allowed latency. Therefore, events with the matching user name that arrive 2 seconds after the expiration of the session are also considered when performing aggregations for the session identified by the given user name. sort (Window) This window holds a batch of events that equal the number specified as the windowLength and sorts them in the given order. Syntax sort( INT window.length, STRING attribute, STRING order) QUERY PARAMETERS Name Description Default Value Possible Data Types Optional Dynamic window.length The size of the window length. INT No No attribute The attribute that should be checked for the order. The concatenation of all the attributes of the event is considered. STRING Yes No order The order define as \"asc\" or \"desc\". asc STRING Yes No Examples EXAMPLE 1 define stream cseEventStream (symbol string, price float, volume long); define window cseEventWindow (symbol string, price float, volume long) sort(2,volume, 'asc'); @info(name = 'query0') from cseEventStream insert into cseEventWindow; @info(name = 'query1') from cseEventWindow select volume insert all events into outputStream ; sort(5, price, 'asc') keeps the events sorted by price in the ascending order. Therefore, at any given time, the window contains the 5 lowest prices. time (Window) A sliding time window that holds events that arrived during the last windowTime period at a given time, and gets updated for each event arrival and expiry. Syntax time( INT|LONG|TIME window.time) QUERY PARAMETERS Name Description Default Value Possible Data Types Optional Dynamic window.time The sliding time period for which the window should hold events.

The events that belong to a specific session are identified by a grouping attribute (i.e., a session key). A session gap period is specified to determine the time period after which the session is considered to be expired. A new event that arrives with a specific value for the session key is matched with the session window with the same session key. When performing aggregations for a specific session, you can include events with the matching session key that arrive after the session is expired if required. This is done by specifying a latency time period that is less than the session gap period. To have aggregate functions with session windows, the events need to be grouped by the session key via a 'group by' clause.

The 'user' attribute is the session key, and the session gap is 5 seconds. '2 sec' is specified as the allowed latency. Therefore, events with the matching user name that arrive 2 seconds after the expiration of the session are also considered when performing aggregations for the session identified by the given user name. sort (Window) This window holds a batch of events that equal the number specified as the windowLength and sorts them in the given order.

The events that belong to a specific session are identified by a grouping attribute (i.e., a session key). A session gap period is specified to determine the time period after which the session is considered to be expired. A new event that arrives with a specific value for the session key is matched with the session window with the same session key. When performing aggregations for a specific session, you can include events with the matching session key that arrive after the session is expired if required. This is done by specifying a latency time period that is less than the session gap period. To have aggregate functions with session windows, the events need to be grouped by the session key via a 'group by' clause. Syntax session( INT|LONG|TIME window.session, STRING window.key, INT|LONG|TIME window.allowedlatency) QUERY PARAMETERS Name Description Default Value Possible Data Types Optional Dynamic window.session The time period for which the session considered is valid. This is specified in seconds, minutes, or milliseconds (i.e., 'min', 'sec', or 'ms'.

The 'user' attribute is the session key, and the session gap is 5 seconds. '2 sec' is specified as the allowed latency. Therefore, events with the matching user name that arrive 2 seconds after the expiration of the session are also considered when performing aggregations for the session identified by the given user name. sort (Window) This window holds a batch of events that equal the number specified as the windowLength and sorts them in the given order. Syntax sort( INT window.length, STRING attribute, STRING order) QUERY PARAMETERS Name Description Default Value Possible Data Types Optional Dynamic window.length The size of the window length. INT No No attribute The attribute that should be checked for the order. The concatenation of all the attributes of the event is considered. STRING Yes No order The order define as \"asc\" or \"desc\". asc STRING Yes No Examples EXAMPLE 1 define stream cseEventStream (symbol string, price float, volume long); define window cseEventWindow (symbol string, price float, volume long) sort(2,volume, 'asc'); @info(name = 'query0') from cseEventStream insert into cseEventWindow; @info(name = 'query1') from cseEventWindow select volume insert all events into outputStream ; sort(5, price, 'asc') keeps the events sorted by price in the ascending order.

The events that belong to a specific session are identified by a grouping attribute (i.e., a session key). A session gap period is specified to determine the time period after which the session is considered to be expired. A new event that arrives with a specific value for the session key is matched with the session window with the same session key. When performing aggregations for a specific session, you can include events with the matching session key that arrive after the session is expired if required. This is done by specifying a latency time period that is less than the session gap period. To have aggregate functions with session windows, the events need to be grouped by the session key via a 'group by' clause.

The 'user' attribute is the session key, and the session gap is 5 seconds. '2 sec' is specified as the allowed latency. Therefore, events with the matching user name that arrive 2 seconds after the expiration of the session are also considered when performing aggregations for the session identified by the given user name. sort (Window) This window holds a batch of events that equal the number specified as the windowLength and sorts them in the given order.

The events that belong to a specific session are identified by a grouping attribute (i.e., a session key). A session gap period is specified to determine the time period after which the session is considered to be expired. A new event that arrives with a specific value for the session key is matched with the session window with the same session key. When performing aggregations for a specific session, you can include events with the matching session key that arrive after the session is expired if required. This is done by specifying a latency time period that is less than the session gap period. To have aggregate functions with session windows, the events need to be grouped by the session key via a 'group by' clause. Syntax session( INT|LONG|TIME window.session, STRING window.key, INT|LONG|TIME window.allowedlatency) QUERY PARAMETERS Name Description Default Value Possible Data Types Optional Dynamic window.session The time period for which the session considered is valid. This is specified in seconds, minutes, or milliseconds (i.e., 'min', 'sec', or 'ms'.

The 'user' attribute is the session key, and the session gap is 5 seconds. '2 sec' is specified as the allowed latency. Therefore, events with the matching user name that arrive 2 seconds after the expiration of the session are also considered when performing aggregations for the session identified by the given user name. sort (Window) This window holds a batch of events that equal the number specified as the windowLength and sorts them in the given order. Syntax sort( INT window.length, STRING attribute, STRING order) QUERY PARAMETERS Name Description Default Value Possible Data Types Optional Dynamic window.length The size of the window length. INT No No attribute The attribute that should be checked for the order. The concatenation of all the attributes of the event is considered.

The events that belong to a specific session are identified by a grouping attribute (i.e., a session key). A session gap period is specified to determine the time period after which the session is considered to be expired. A new event that arrives with a specific value for the session key is matched with the session window with the same session key. When performing aggregations for a specific session, you can include events with the matching session key that arrive after the session is expired if required. This is done by specifying a latency time period that is less than the session gap period. To have aggregate functions with session windows, the events need to be grouped by the session key via a 'group by' clause.

The 'user' attribute is the session key, and the session gap is 5 seconds. '2 sec' is specified as the allowed latency. Therefore, events with the matching user name that arrive 2 seconds after the expiration of the session are also considered when performing aggregations for the session identified by the given user name. sort (Window) This window holds a batch of events that equal the number specified as the windowLength and sorts them in the given order.

The events that belong to a specific session are identified by a grouping attribute (i.e., a session key). A session gap period is specified to determine the time period after which the session is considered to be expired. A new event that arrives with a specific value for the session key is matched with the session window with the same session key. When performing aggregations for a specific session, you can include events with the matching session key that arrive after the session is expired if required. This is done by specifying a latency time period that is less than the session gap period. To have aggregate functions with session windows, the events need to be grouped by the session key via a 'group by' clause. Syntax session( INT|LONG|TIME window.session, STRING window.key, INT|LONG|TIME window.allowedlatency) QUERY PARAMETERS Name Description Default Value Possible Data Types Optional Dynamic window.session The time period for which the session considered is valid. This is specified in seconds, minutes, or milliseconds (i.e., 'min', 'sec', or 'ms'.

The 'user' attribute is the session key, and the session gap is 5 seconds. '2 sec' is specified as the allowed latency. Therefore, events with the matching user name that arrive 2 seconds after the expiration of the session are also considered when performing aggregations for the session identified by the given user name. sort (Window) This window holds a batch of events that equal the number specified as the windowLength and sorts them in the given order. Syntax sort( INT window.length, STRING attribute, STRING order) QUERY PARAMETERS Name Description Default Value Possible Data Types Optional Dynamic window.length The size of the window length. INT No No attribute The attribute that should be checked for the order. The concatenation of all the attributes of the event is considered.
